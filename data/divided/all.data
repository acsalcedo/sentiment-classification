      This story was a nice surprise for me! I expected a sci fi mystery type story going through the details of Dr. Brody Springer discovering a new planet that was first predicted by his late wife, Hope. What this story ended up being, for me at least, was...a love story. There was mystery, action, f...
      Loved it. Great read!

      I read John Haywood's Nonfiction book Viking the Norse warrior's manual. This book tells you how to be a good Viking warrior by telling how to act at feast where to sit and what good qualities to look for in your warband leader. The book tells you how Viking men and children train. People who are...
      If you speak English, read it now. Si habláis español, esperad a la versión en español. ;)
      Light and humorous. This book shows the intense bond between triplet women in their 30's.
      Different than what I had expected. I enjoyed it, a different twist than a shifter type paranormal romance.
      **I received a free e-book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does in no way alter my opinions**<br /><br />I’ve been wanting this book for so long, so when I saw it on Netgalley, I was so excited to read it!! I’d heard pretty much only good things before reading, so my expectations were pr...

      ***** ANOTHER WINNER!<br /><br />The fourth book in the Rolling Thunder Series, “Gunnin’ For You,” starts out with a bang––sexually, and as it turns out, metaphorically as well. It’s a great portrayal of a man’s discomfort with empty sex and his unconscious need for something deeper. And what that scene does...
      that wonderful combination of a window into deeply personal emotions yet inviting enough to allow universal enrichment. <br /><br />sensitive to emotions of glancing.
      <strong>The suspense increases!</strong><br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Colleen Coble, and have read nearly all of her books. This latest one is more suspenseful than ever. I was guessing all through the storyline and had several surprises at the end. Delightful characters, with secrets of their past, but overcoming those obst...
      An 'interesting' look at what it's like when friends become family, even at the expense of family. I liked her characters and her writing style a lot, very enjoyable find.
      <strong>The Last Illusion </strong><br /><br />A wonderful Molly Murphy mystery. Bowen outdid herself on this one. The note at the end of the book reinforced my thoughts as I read that this story was based on some true facts. You will love this book.<br /><br />

From the beginning the only one really on her side is her twin brother Mohammed. With the backdrop of pos...
      Once I remembered that Fannie Flagg's books are more like a series of connected short stories, I enjoyed this much more. This book is a more cohesive story than some of the others, but some of the chapters seem to have no point other than to be glimpses into a particular character's life. I did e...

      <strong>A Romantic novel</strong><br /><br />This is a very romantic novel. It's really breathtaking. I recommend it to everyone who loves romanticism. Two thumbs up!
      I happened upon this book in my local library and was intrigued by the cover and the title. So I borrowed it.. Went back to the library 3 days later for the other 2 in the series. I love it and want more.
      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />An entertaining insiders look at African tourist camps. This couple had experiences with staff, wild animals, and the bosses family border on the unbelievable.
      I’m not sure how much I can say about this book without ruining it for everyone. It is not my intention to reveal any spoilers or expose any secrets so bear with me as I try to review it without giving anything away. Harry Potter and friends are back for their sixth year at Hogwarts. All of our f...
      The title of the book gives away the tragedy that happens in the first chapter, a tragedy that, in most other books, would usually be left until at least some of the characters and back story were known. Then the story moves back in time before the tragic event and then after it with each chapter...
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />I liked this book as much as Mama Does Time. I am again looking forward to the southern antics of mama the three sisters.
      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I just started this series and I can hardly wait to read the rest of the books. Hope everyone else enjoys them as much as l have so far.
      <strong>Makes perfect sense!</strong><br /><br />An amazing read I will never look at food the same in the best possible way. I can not wait to adapt to a new lifestyle. Thank you!!<br /><br />
      <strong>Much better than expected</strong><br /><br />White following the basic romance formula, this piece is very well written with good characters and plot twists that keep the reader engaged. I look forward to the next installment.
      <strong>Great story and interesting sub narratives </strong><br /><br />Great story and interesting sub narrative. Really helps you experience the time and how America allowed for the rise of Hitler.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />Really enjoyed the book. Can't wait for the next one to be published. Will read her other books for now
      I freely admit, I had to read this one with the lights on...in every room in my flat or in broad daylight. Yes, I'm a fraidy cat and there isn't one Stephen King book in my extensive collection because I am a fradiy cat. That being said, I can't pass on any Lexxie Couper book; so the lights were...

      Year of Ravens is a unique look at Boudica's rebellion against Rome. Seven different authors have told the story through seven different lenses, so you get the grit of battle from the perspective of a Roman warrior, the magic of the isle of Mona as told by a young druid, and the aftermath of the...
      I really enjoyed reading “Simon” by Michael Mullin I thought it was excellently written with very clean editing (I notice things like that!) and kept my attention from the dramatic opening to the bittersweet end. I read it relatively quickly and loved the characters and the fresh twist that the a...
      It's a toga dropper!<br />Arthur Griffin’s, “The Lusty Adventures of Theseus”, is exactly what the author promises. This retelling of the Theseus myth casts the ancient Greek bastard prince as a wayward lad in search of himself. Theseus personal growth is aided with the help of lusty, worldly Pirithuou...
      Desperately Seeking Epic……. I’m desperately seeking another box of tissues and a glass of wine! This isn’t my first book with BN Toler.

      <strong>Amish Young Love</strong><br /><br />I have recently had to read to help relax for bed and to get to sleep these stories are prefect
      <strong>Interesting</strong><br /><br />Enough but lagged in the end. Too much about the court scenes and not enough real meat to the story. I don't like being left hanging at the end,so will not bother with any more of the series.
      Such an amazing book, I was wanting to reread it a month after i finished it
      Not a huge fan of graphic novels but this was laugh out loud funny.
      Loved it
      My Thoughts<br /><br />I watched The Bachelor and The Bachelorette when Emily was on and I remember her being my favorite. I was pulling for her and hoping she would find love both times and was sad when things didn’t work out for her. So, when I saw this book I was so excited to read and review it!<br /><br />I wasn’t...
      Absolutely fantastic narration elevates this thriller into a good solid 4.5 star listen. The story itself is perhaps your standard thriller fare (decently written but nothing to shout from the rooftops about), but it's worth the listen if you like audiobooks. Really well done.
      Best bio I have read in a while. Loved it! Can't imagine living a life so full. And... It's a great love story.
      Taylor Boothe 8-Red pg240 Book Review 7<br /><br />"The story of my life" was one of the most inspiring things you will ever read. "The Story of my Life" is an autobiography by Helen Keller. It's always interesting to see what goes on in someone's life and their point of view. I also loved the way she uses a...
      Intense.
      <strong>WOW !</strong><br /><br />I like reading a good book when it's just that .... a good book....<br />I looked forward to opening my kindle each time. The story definitely keeps you guessing about her true identity.... then when you finish the vook
      new babes<br />
      Beautiful. Broken. Heart-wrenching. And ultimately, Hopeful.
      A Splendor of Letters is an informative, entertaining and ultimately downright inspiring paean to books. Four stars Not the least of the book's merits is that it's like a friend telling you about stuff you'll want to read about- see The Club Dumas, my next read.
      Insightful and actionable. Not entirely new information but good to hear it again.
      Steve Martin is one intense guy.
      <strong>Unputdownable</strong><br /><br />A very enjoyable read, an old story made believable. Each character came to life . once again Nora Lofts proved her gift.
      great book. I used to live in the area for a few years and reading this book reminded me of the great things in the area.
      Not enough of a story.
      One of my favorite Comics, such a good story, fantasic art and great characters, definitely a should read
      Loved Rosemarie's voice. A very worthy read-- from the author who was front center at George Magazine &amp; the assistant to John Kennedy Jr. Heartfelt, honest,--funny and heartbreaking-- One could relate to having work days named "opposite day" &amp; "because I said so" day; ---the boss is not p...
      <strong>Great job!</strong><br /><br />I gave 5 stars because I couldn't put it down. I like the characters especially Conrad. I'm a big fan of the author and love her style.
      <strong>I laughed so hard I cried!</strong><br /><br />OMG!!! This book is exactly what I needed! It was hilarious, light hearted and much fun to read! Olivia and Oren make such an awesome couple! I love the relationship Olivia has with her dad and her bff Scout!!!! Five stars for sure
      <strong>Reminiscent of "Room"</strong><br /><br />A dysfunctional family and their mysteries, explored by an 11-year-old boy who loves them fiercely yet suspects there's a dark background to his family's life in the basement. Bizarre, complex characterizations and a surprising plot. A worthwhile read.
      Full of laugh out loud and swoon worthy moments. I absolutely loved Matt! Such a manwhore but commits when he knows what he wants. You don't have to read the Bliss series to read this book but if you're like me and love to know the other characters' stories, I would recommend reading those first....
      Only one word: <br />AMAZING!!!!!!!
      Very basic, but a good summary of many aspects of politics
      I HAVE NOT FINISHED
      Read it for school, looking forward to talking about it with some of the older students.
      One of my favorite comprehensive vegetarian cookbooks.
      The incredible story of this curious traveler coming from Grenada who was captured by Pirates and sold to the Pope became his geographer.
      This was on the reading list for the history part of my German Studies degree. Quite an eye opener and written in a way laymen like myself could appreciate.
      The concept was intriguing but the story felt too simplistic, as if the author ran out of ideas after the initial good one. The characters were flat and cliched.
      This was was book chosen for the Ann Arbor Reads. <br />The life of several immigrants from Latin America trying to make it in America. It was not a hopeful picture. <br />
      Another entertaining and fun read.

      Excellent, excellent novel! Very enjoyable and hard to put down.
      This book was fantastic. I really thought she was becoming crazy.
      I loved this book so much! it was heavy in ots content and made me feel the panic and sorrow on the protagonist and all the kids in the panopticon. However, it was readable and I skimmed through it easily. I loved this book so much.
      <strong>I really enjoyed this book</strong><br /><br />So I started reading this on a whim, got into the book very easily and enjoyed the story very much.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />This book was hard to put down with so many twists and turns. I'm usually able to figure out who the villain is early on in a book but not this one. Really enjoyed it.

      <strong>Excellent read!</strong><br /><br />Victoria captures you from the moment you begin cheering for Mare to the final page. I am losing sleep waiting to get my hands on Glass Sword!
      <strong>Orchids and stone</strong><br /><br />This book was a bit boring and centered around a character with very little depth. Not as interesting as I had hoped.
      <strong>Excellent book. </strong><br /><br />Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next instalment of DI Dixon and his trusty sidekick Jane. Each book gets better and better.
      "Escaped the Night” by Jennifer Blyth was one of the most unexpectedly awesome books I’ve read in a while. To be totally honest, at first I wasn’t sure I’d like it because I had a hard time figuring out what it was about from the description, and I’ve been a bit burned out on paranormal lately (*...
      This book is worth all the hype. I can't put into words why, but I identify so much with the narrator.
      4 Stars. I really enjoyed this series. I wish the epilogue was a little more in depth.
      Great graphic novel for young teens, relationships and friendships set during a school production. I can she who so many of our junior students love this. I really likes the illustrations, as well as they story.
      I Loved it!!!!!!!
      4.5 stars<br />honestly this is the first book I’ve read on this subject and it is such an important concept! I’m literally wondering how I’ve made it this far without reading something like this before now. It felt so good to hear about how others cope with various situations in life, and in that way...
      <strong>My appreciation of San Francisco...</strong><br /><br />...has grown after reading this awesome novel! I couldn't put it down. Now, getting "More Tales of the City." It's addicting!
      4-4.5 stars.
      This Bible study covers the last 27 chapters of Isaiah in eleven weeks.

      This is a retelling of the Pygmalion story or if you are not familiar with that, “My Fair Lady”.

      <strong>Funny and true</strong><br /><br />A lot of the stories in this book are common sense. But there's a light, humorous tone all mothers appreciate because we've all been there.
      Great book. Love Lenora Worth's writing. She's a great story teller, one that you'll fall in love with the characters, well written and fast paced.
      Possibly 3.75, but we'll leave it as 4 stars for now :D

      My book group read this in February and it was one of the only books on which we all agreed. I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was an interesting premise and although other books have been written about hostage situations, this one wasn't all about shooting things and high action. Instead...
      I do not give five stars easily, but this book deserves twenty-hands down one of my favorites. I read it in two days and actually had to ration it because I didn't want it to end. I spent the last forty pages sobbing and actually had to stop reading at one point because I was crying too much to s...
      This is only delicious if you really enjoy the taste of cliches.
      What a fabulous radio adaption. One of my favorites. The acting was superb. Highly recommend.

      A great start to the series! I fell in love with the characters right away! A family of witches with a great dynamic, and excellent support characters.

      it's amazing book
      As with author Pryce’s other romance from Montlake, this is a story filled with witty phrases, sensual descriptions, and characters for whom we hope the best. Though at first the participants may seem stock characters—the mysterious nobleman, the jealous cousin, the woman given to one but wanted...
      "You can't have a romantic relationship if you can't touch your partner" is basically what Juliette is teaching young readers in this book. Great job.
      This was the first book I’ve read by this author G.A. Beller, but I certainly hope it’s not the last. He has a gift for writing descriptive and life-like scenes that make us feel like we are really there inside the story, as opposed to it all just being rehashed to us and keeping us away from the...

      Loved every bit of this.
      clearly a 4 star read, but I'm gonna go ahead and put a 5 on it - so emotional right now.
      I'm not sure I even know where to start with this book. One of the biggest complaints I’ve read about this book are the romantic interests. Main character shows interest in two people. Honestly, this doesn't bother me much most of the time in books; it’s teenagers. High Schoolers tend to ‘crush’...
      It's a really nice book and I can say that I can relate because I suffered from anxiety and I learn new technique ...

      <strong>The best</strong><br /><br />These books are killer...so great you can't put down..now to wait for more of the story. They only get better
      "The Fall” was a very original take on ‘fiction’ for me, and at times it seemed like I was reading a recounting of something “real” that had happened, even though that is obviously not the case. I know that all fiction novels are like that (realistic-feeling stories that are made up), but this on...

      <strong>Couldn't put it down</strong><br /><br />I could not put this book down. It took a bit to get used to the writing style since it is written in a five year old boy's perspective. Great story line and details!
      Excellent and complex journey story.
      Excellent insights!
      <strong>Pure Entertainment!</strong><br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable read! Nothing less should be expected: An undead family ... Krampus ... and authored by Jeff O'Brien. So pick up a copy ... Take a short adventure in your mind and read this story ... nothing can go wrong ...
      So interesting and unique. Not like anything I've read before, but somehow reminiscent of other books that I liked.
      Great book from the Américas Award collection

      Excellent resource for the classroom!
      Stunning. Read in one session. An experience to repeat - soon!
      Beautiful writing that captures the feeling of exploration and the opportunity of 'just going'. The overall tone is realistic, yet encouraging for women exploring on their own. Great book.
      I received a copy of this book from Netgalley, but that did not influence my review.<br /><br />This book was not entirely new to me as if you spend a lot of time on the internet, you’ve probably seen some of Andersen’s work. However, it’s no less amusing on the second viewing. I imagine this book is relatab...
      I absolutely loved his book. Pam is great at detailing where to visit and why locations on the island are best for different travelers. She makes what would normally be pretty mundane reading funny and I laughed out loud more than once. I can't wait to apply the information in her book to my upco...
      A beautiful picture book with a story I was familiar with--the loving devotion of Hachiko, a dog in Japan who waits for ten years at the railway station hoping for the return of his master who died at work so never came home on the train one day.
      Loved this book, was really intriguing the entire way through. Would definitely recommend for adults interested in mystery/fantasy.
      it's really hard to explain how I felt about this book. It was intense that's for sure, and just over some damn chocolates. but the chocolate wasnt what's important, its the power balance and politics of the school, which I found disgusting yet well developed. I couldn't put the book down, but no...

      <strong>A great follow-up to Book 1. Now onto Book 3</strong><br /><br />I've always loved historical fiction and when it encompasses the theme of Christianity and the love of God it makes for an especially inspirational read.

      Watership Down is my favourite book of all time. I often revisit the world of rabbits. It is incredibly well-written and the use of rabbit-language really brings this too life, not to mention the incredible descriptive work.<br /><br />Worth a read, always.
      Good follow up to the 5th Wave. More insight into the other characters. Really like this one.
      inspired me to read more fairy tale twists....
      Stevens is quite the fabulous narrator. The movie was also excellent, though I prefer the final scene in the book.
      This book has no merit at all. Why it us selected for any purpose by anyone us beyond me.
      <strong>Interesting read!</strong><br /><br />It is a quick read! Grabs and keeps your attention! I would recommend to young adults and adults! I enjoyed it

      Fuck this book. No one read it. The first story was annoying, the second story was sexist and offensive and the third story's protagonist was so unlikable that I was rooting for her to be unhappy. Seriously, don't read this piece of trash.

      <strong>Far from my normal genre</strong><br /><br />Very impressed with this young author. She's certainly one to watch. Since this is far outside the type of books I usually read, I approached it with an open mind. <br /><br />And I'm glad I did.
      It was AWESOME!!!!!
      The book had interesting characters and I, generally, liked the story. However, I find it highly distracting when words break across lines and pages. In addition, I saw several places that were missing commas, which always takes me out of the story.
      Loved the adventure and humour of this story! Good fun for young and old.

      Galfard's stated aim is not to leave anyone behind and indeed, I could keep up until the start of the last section. First book of heavy cosmology that could take me that far. Call it Brief History of Time for Normal People.

His evolution from single with never any ties, to deny any type of...
      The Three Pigs by David Wiesner is a fun twist on the classic book The Three Little Pigs. The book starts the same way as the classic but soon takes an unexpected turn when the pigs figure out how to get out of their story and into other classic children’s books leaving the big bad wolf confused...
      Brilliantly written!!
      I have really enjoyed the characters in this series about wolves that have recently claimed their mates. It did not start out as well as they hoped and they have had to make a lot of adjustments <br /><br />In this part of the story, in addition to the two couples from the first book, we are introduced to Ve...
      Pure Brilliance.
      My review for volumes 1 and 2 are going to be identical because the books were so similar and I received them at the same time. I found the book to be interesting and I loved the pictures. I think that, without the pictures, the book wouldn’t be of use to anyone. It might be nice for the author t...

      <strong>Ok</strong><br /><br />It is short but I like it! When you make another one please make it lounger<br />And putt a couple of pig's in?
      <strong>Great history</strong><br /><br />Should be enjoyed by all. "......................loved it ,"..."...................you will like but start with the first volume Read on. You will enjoy the drama !
      enjoyed this fast paced novella filled with steamy scenes and strong willed men. When Bailey travels across the country to meet her family, she has a one night stand. When she realizes the guy is her brother's best friend, sparks fly. Can they have a HEA? What will her family have to say about it...
      I was given a copy for a fair and honest review.<br /><br />I have not read many books in this genre, but I loved this book. It had everything a great book should have - great writing, great characters and a story that grabs you and never lets you go. I was so wrapped up in this story, I almost burned dinner...
      Loved this book. I like her postcard format at the first of each chapter and love the adventures she has. I plan on rereading this one and have lent it to many.
      week 9
      It shows how easily people can be persuaded if you have the right evidence. Also, that you should not judge someone on instinct.
      I listened to the audiobook version, which I highly recommend. Great narrator.
      i could not get into the story.
      I was sent a copy of this book for review purposes, as always, all opinions are my own<br /><br />There are many things I look forward to after a long winter—sunshine is obviously one of them, but the new Spring cookbook releases may even beat out the prospect of warmer weather and flip flops. In the past fe...
      Philip Pullman, I'm deeply unimpressed. I read your trilogy, I got attached to Lyra and Will, just to see you fuck up their lives in a final plot that was as unnecessary as it was incomplete. dafuq happened to the prophecy, dafuq happened with these 2 lovable characters who we have no closure for...
      This is a heartwarming and tear jerking story of a mans love for his dog. It was incredibly well written and so easy to relate to. I am more of a cat person but could certainly understand the special relationship between a person and their pet.
      Read this young and adored it!
      Love Adams sense of humor!!!
      <strong>He did it again....</strong><br /><br />Slow burn is a series that I have read many times. Love the characters, love the story. Bobby brings Zed and Murphy back again for more mayhem and Null spot the destroyer. He brought someone else back too... :-)
      Historia, misterio, arte. <br />Simplemente perfecto
      Really great read! Couldn't put it down (:
      I love this book! Read it several times!
      These books are increasingly poorly written, descending into gratuitous violence and lack of plot. I kind of enjoyed the first novel, but after the escape from the maze it lost direction, credibility, and, frankly, interest.
      I enjoyed this great Australian novel. Ruby and Jimmy married and were going to live the idea life but war stood in the way. Ruby was very resourceful and got a job in a timber yard, not the usual place for a woman. When Jimmy returns injured life becomes very difficult for all concerned. I found...
      One of my favorites - loved the entire triology!
      Cynthia agrees to what she thinks is a menage. Reality is completely different. Fallon is the chieftain of the puca clan. His friend brings Cyn to be his mate. This is quite a surprise for her. This is a very entertaining story. This part of the Ride series is just as good a the first. I definite...
      My heart hurts.
      When I am in the right mood, I plan to read this. Not a fan of deceased spouse tropes, but this storyline still appeals to me.
      <strong>A great story of forgiveness, faith, and love</strong><br /><br />Where do I even start? I loved this story - probably my favorite in the series so far. The emotions , the way the story was told, everything!! And dang it - Isaacson made me cry again!!!
      Bukunya bagus, bacanya hampir sebulan, hahaaha... Ini buku nohok banget dah, banyak yg perlu diperbaiki for myself dlm masalh komunikasi
      I read this over spring break. It was an Amazon freebie. I was very interested in the characters and the genre. I will be looking for the sequels!
      This is #25 in the series which says a lot for it right there. Sandford tells great stories that are believable. This book has more of Letty in it which is great. I hope she keeps appearing as she gets older and maybe even break off into a series of her own.
      <strong>If you have writer's block</strong><br /><br />Give this a read! This book is a great reminder to not take yourself too seriously. Pick your pen back up (or your paintbrush or your microphone) and get creating.

Did they change your way of thinking?<br /><br />Gaby is a mother, sister, and the backbone of her family and community. She is loved by many and definite...
      After reading Stiletto Safari I decided I would read Stiletto Sunset and read it in one sitting. Again this was a light happy read. Zara moves to London with her Hamish but really misses her friends in New York. The story is well written and very enjoyable.
      This is history; the country's tragic loss that cannot be summed up in so many words. I felt the need to look at the faces, the names &amp; read a word or two of their day to day lives. The Collection: of people who were gone in an instant &amp; the letter "Y" will always dangle in my head as I r...
      "A thrilling "true" story, about a teenager who sails around the world, ALONE, her cat is her only companion. Tania Aebi blooms with courage and tenacity. I blong this book. I cried at the ending."
      So helpful, amazing styles, detailed instructions.
      <strong>Awesome book</strong><br /><br />This was a great book. The power of forgiveness is key. I can understand how to let go and let God be in control.
      This is testimony from children who witnessed what was happening to their own Jewish families long before the war; in 1933, children terrified at school, their annexation from society.

      My favorite book-signing :)
      <strong>...</strong><br /><br />Not really sure what to say.. I did not like this book at all, but wasn't the worst. The editing was horrible.
      <strong>Good</strong><br /><br />If you like shifter stories that are straight to the point with a little humor on the side this one is for you.
      I was provided an arc in exchange for an honest review and that review is going to be short and to the point.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Laramie Briscoe and her Heaven Hill series. She is a talented writer. I’m not going to summarize the story as that’s been done. <br /><br />As for Sass, I give...
      "A perfect book for those engaged, thinking about it and married &amp; SINGLE! Entertaining, laugh out loud &amp; factual."
      Aunque me ha gustado, me gustó mucho más la primera parte
      <strong>Good Book</strong><br /><br />This is a well written story. The characters are well developed. There are some twists and turns. I'm looking forward to. The next book.
      Bees have been a hot topic for a few years now, primarily due to the mysterious deaths of entire colonies and the ensuing research to try and figure out what was going wrong. However, bees have been vital to our lives and our economy for many, many years before that. This humble insect pollinates...
      This book has transformed my marriage and my life. I recommend it to every married couple I know. I only wish there was a book with the same understanding of differentiation I could recommend to teenagers and unmarried friends so that they can get a jump on the concept before they get married the...
      A heart shattered, her eyes blank with emptiness. Life is unrecognizable. Numb and confused; Wendy is the collateral damage of a life that no longer exists. An authentic teen voice of 9/11."
      This story really shows you the resiliency of the human spirit. This is a woman's struggle with life which includes, being in an unhappy marriage and then having not one but two children who have special needs. As for Hannah the baby it's unbelievable what she went through and to be a mother to s...

      Super report of an abused child who grew into an abusive, murdering g, raping adult. Put to death for his crimes in 1985, about 40 years too late.

      It comes as no surprise that Julia Donaldson, Author of The Grufflo, is an incredible Children's book writer. She has absolutely done it again with The Snail and the Whale (Ok, Ok it was 10 years ago, but it's new to me!). The creativity and originality burst through on every page with every twis...
      Another great one by Joseph Boyden...though I liked Into Black Spruce a little bit more.
      Que esta antología sirva para reconciliarse con la literatura (porque nunca es suficiente).
      Fearless Beans is about a small white dog who gathers up bravery for every adventure that comes his way. The phrase “really, really ready” is repeated throughout which could be fun to use as a theatrical point when reading the story out loud.<br /><br />I imagine a 3-5 year old would like hearing this story...

      The mountaintop epiphany experienced by Hans Castorp was worth the mind bend that is this great novel.

      I started the book on wattpad. I really didn't expect it to be sooooo damn good I knocked senseless  totally a must read
      It was a great thriller and I didn't suspect the true evil until it practically was in front of me, the story was interesting and kept me thinking about all the possible suspects. Looking firearm to trying the next in this series!
      <strong>Loved it</strong><br /><br />Lani, you did again! Awesome story, easy to relate to....felt like you took me on a journey of my own life lol
      great descriptions, a nice change with an interesting set of circumstances
      great read
      This is pretty cute. If you're expecting Shakespeare, read Shakespeare. This is good for what it is.

She has always helped others and this shelter is almost everything to her. The rest of her is consumed by the two men she loves. Gabrial, crime lord of Southe...
      <strong>Adorable!!!</strong><br /><br />This book is adorable from start to finish! The characters are oh so fascinating! The transformation of the couple is remarkable and makes for a very pleasing read.
      Letto alle elementari... forzatamente e svogliatamente. Ora capisco perchè lo facciano leggere, ma rimane una sorta di "trauma". Indipendentemente da come è scritto (suppongo bene visto il suo successo) io proprio non lo posso vedere. :(
      <strong>Pleasantly surprising</strong><br /><br />This is a nice story, very well written. This book kept me interested throughput . I would recommend reading the first book to the series.
      This is a very mixed bag. There's some crazy beauty, a fair amount of sexism, and a handful of duds. I liked it, though. <br />
      <strong>Nice</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed the whole re-telling. Each chapter switches between the main characters but I didn't find it bothersome or too repetitive. I was able to become invested in the characters. The prose was easy to read and it felt authentic.
      This little noir style novella made my day. Lily calls on Jack to help her sister out. Jack finds out Lily has alterior motives for the call. 2nd book to Til the End of the Line", Where you meet Jack's brother. I can't wait until Donovan writes another book! <br /><br />Donovan has a way with words, you get...
      Wow great second book to the series.. I loved it, keep bringing hotness to this series. Syn and Furi were epic together..
      Awesome book! Highly recommend.
      <strong>Wow</strong><br /><br />A moving and perfectly paced tale by an author who has the ability to share a multi layered story with skill and talent. Highly Recommended!
      This book is ideal for anyone that wants to learn alot about the real jamaican culture and some of the creole too, akthough you might have to get someone that speaks the dialect or understands it to help you with those parts in book. the story is very interesting and related to many young people...
      After seeing the move The Best Of Me, I knew I had to read the book. Surprisingly, there were many big difference between the two. At first it irritated me but then I was able to appreciate them separately. The book gives us insight into what the characters are thinking and feeling making it easi...
      Fucking brilliant!!! Could not put it down!!
      One of the better written of the genre; many interesting anecdotes - some humorous, some touching, some eye-opening, but all take the reader to the scene, and all have some sort of closure.
      Very unique book. Interesting concepts of travel through different dimensions.<br /><br />
      I thought this was a great mystery/thriller. Kept me guessing with a few twists and turns. I'm very claustrophobic and found it tough to read some of the detailed descriptions of Flora's captivity, but that speaks to the impressive and descriptive writing skills of the author.
      Judge and Austin are like dynamite when you get them in the same room.. This series is absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to read more.
      This was a little disappointing, the other books were so full of so much... Well it at least ended as expected. <br />
      loved this book even though it's gotten a bit of slack! yes it is similar to other YA novels and has a LOT of tropes but it was just an enjoyable read that I sped through and always looked forward to reading!<br /><br />however, I was spoiled for the ending simply from everyone just hinting and talking about...
      wow.

      Couldn't put it down!
      Return to Me is such a sweet but great read. The type of book that makes you wish to be part of this fairy-tale story. The type that most women wish to be swept off their feet by a charming and beautiful man in real life.<br /><br />When is meant to be, love will always conquer. No matter what the circumstan...
      <strong>A STRANGE AND GRUESOME STORY</strong><br /><br />There is little merit to this tale. It is inconclusive and not worth spending time on. It has no redeeming qualities. I do not recommend it.
      Fun book, love the drawings and reading about food is always nice!
      <strong>I loved it.</strong><br /><br />Didn't realize I had already read this book until I started it. It was part of an anthology. I can't wait for chance to come out. I love this series
      Very good
      Amazing. Will transform your view on money. I've read rich dad, poor dad and this is actually practical. You can put this book down and put it into action immediately.

      After finishing Pushkin, and while waiting for Lermontov, I picked this one up.<br />It was great. Quick, taut, intriguing stories in a cold climate where the light of day is<br />sporadic.
      I had just a bit of a hard time getting into the story line of this book. It starts out with the death of Karlinah's husband. You know that she has a secret about what has happened to him, but it takes quite a while in the book to actually learn what happened to him. <br /><br />Karlinah doesn't want to stay...
      This story is an interesting twist on two people renewing their love affair after many years of separation. Most of the book is the back story – how Jen and Phil spent their lives after breaking up when they were young – and when they meet after 20 years and the ending of other relationships, the...
      LOVE THIS BOOK! :) They get married OMG!
      Lovely!
      في طيات هذه الرواية إرشادات للرجال حتى لا يكفوا عن رجولتهم<br />هذه الرواية صالحة للقراءة في أي زمن، وأحتفظ بها لأنك ستحتاج تقرأها مرة أخرى <br />وفرغ نفسك أكثر من أي وقت آخر لأن كلمات أحلام لا تمضي بالسهولة التي تفعلها كلمات روائيين آخرين
      I received this book in exchange for an honest review.

What I loved about this book is that you have this fun little frog...
      <strong>Holy Catfish this book ROCKS</strong><br /><br />I loved Bones, and I want to BE Cat. For anyone who loves paranormal romance, give this one a go.<br />Best novel I've read lately.<br />I'll definitely be looking for more from Jeaniene Frost.
      This book is very short, but very good.
      So fun to be back in Lou's world. Really enjoyed it. Kiiiiiiiiiiind of unbelievable at times, but still very good.

      This book is a letter that Barack Obama wrote to his daughters. It is a good book to share with students because it shows them they can grow up and be whatever they want to be. It also makes references to Historical figures. In his letter Obama uses repetition.
      Five stars!<br /><br /> I havent read a series in years where i have been on the edge of my seat! This one clearly takes the cake. All the characters and plot twists are very fast paced, and the plot keeps thickening as the story goes on. <br /><br />Highly recommend to finish all 6 books in the series! Hey, Stephen Kin...
      <strong>So good!</strong><br /><br />Loved this book I could not put it down. I really got involved in the characters and I loved that there was not to much drama! Had a feel good vibe about it.
      A spectacular ending to a really engaging series!
      <strong>Fun</strong><br /><br />This book was a fun an entertaining read. If you like witches and mystery then you will enjoy this book. Going to continue reading the rest of the series!
      I thought that this was an excellent book that was easy to read and practical. So many things I'm reading are too quick to say that everyone is different. This book looks more specifically at they types of different things women go through and gives actual suggestions for working through them.<br /><br />I c...
      Well, I guess that I am crazy because this book of stories didn’t bowl me over as I expected and as it did most everyone else. It is not the darkness of them. I enjoy a gothic twist. A Good Man Is Hard To Find, the first story, lured me in a bit but the stories went down from there. Neither the c...
      There's plenty of pressure for teens to have sex and many give in. When a romantic evening between Val Jensen and her boyfriend Zach turns into a breakup because he can't accept her decision to remain a virgin until marriage, little does she know how widespread the effects will be. It begins with...
      It is an interesting little book about relationships. I might be too young to understand some of them but it is portraying common situations and talks that we experience. Mostly how we avoid answering questions and how we destroy ourself by creating problems.
      Sweet, enjoyable. A nice read. Not amazing, but I would recommend it.
      Loved this book!
      A wonderful introduction for children to the world of microbes, good and bad. A great addition to the elementary school library!
      I sincerely hope there is more to this branch of the Outlander story! I love these two characters.
      It was a great book except for the ending... I HATE cliffhangers!
      I picked up the book because of it was labelled 'spiritual horror' and it certainly delivers on that front. It's an intriguing and fascinating story that is frightening and clever. After another split from her boyfriend Shane, Jael moves away and via the Internet gets involved with Mike. Soon her...
      Lots of NJ attitude while a divorced mom tries to renovate a guesthouse for income. She discovers two ghosts on the premises who want her to discover their murderer. Soon she starts receiving threats on her life from unknown sources.
      Beautiful.
      I don't think Skippyjon Jones is my thing...
      Very excited for book 2
      <strong>Another Spectacular Yarros story</strong><br /><br />What wasn't to like? The characters and backgrounds were so rich and full. Bash and Emmy were an amazing couple with their own flaws. They worked through it all and built something bigger than themselves. For a novella, the story was deep and the emotions were raw....
      Great book. Loved every page. Never saw the ending coming.
      Love Todd Parr, as always!

      Depressing story. But I love the author's creative descriptions and her ability to write.
      <strong>Can't wait to read #2</strong><br /><br />Loved this first book in the Strand brothers series. A very strong alpha male and a very strong female. The actual storyline wasn't finished, so hope it takes up, where this one left off.
      This book is not just for kids, good for any age reader!
      This novel by a Nobel winning author includes in its fictional basis the disaster story of the Wilhelm Gustloff. The narrative is woven around the historical event and the life and thoughts of the main character who was supposedly born right after the ship sank. Tediously introspective, the book...
      <strong>A great entertaining read</strong><br /><br />A good plot with a number of twists and turns. I found it difficult to put down and would recommend it to all the " who dunnit" readers
      great
      A wonderful tale of everyone deserves a second chance and never judge a person by reputation there are always three sides to every story
      The book was good but it took me a while to get into it and finish.
      <strong>Scary...</strong><br /><br />These days I read a great deal of extreme horror with crazy amounts of shock and blood. This ... is not that. Rector submits to readers the kind of stories that make you truly frightened ... afraid to get out of bed but also terrified to stay in bed ... yet paralyzed. Yeah. This ... dear...
      <strong>Beautiful, moving and heart lifting!!</strong><br /><br />Loved this wonderful book and story! Understand this is Ms Ibrahim's first novel and can't wait to read more in the future! Thank you for the blessing you gave me in reading this book, Laila Ibrahim!! :)
      My very favorite Pearl Buck. One of my favorite novels of all time.
      <strong>Excellent read</strong><br /><br />I started this book not knowing what to expect. I got more than I bargained for. This book has everything in it: murder, little bit of romance. Read it ASAP
      4 e 1/2
      <strong>Anna and her daughters</strong><br /><br />I chose 4 stars because I just wanted to keep reading and not stop. If you enjoy lovely enchanting words that cause you to feel your right there then read this I hoped the vending and it did not dissapoint
      Great course for everyone.
      The Scottish Outlaws is a great series. Quinn, book two, can be read alone, but is better after reading book one, Jack. <br />Quinn not only rescues Lady Catarina, but finds love. Quinn and Catarina's characters are well written and likable. Lily Baldwin is doing an excellent job on the series. I will...

      It is actually a pretty good book. I'm usually not that impressed with shifting books, but that one is unexpected, easy to read and interesting.
      <br />Personal Response- When I was younger I read this book a lot. I did not understand the actual meaning behind the story. After I was done reading this story to my younger brother I realized the actual meaning behind the story. Through this story Dr. Seuss was allowing younger children to see that...
      K Is For Killer<br />A lady at work recommended this one to me and loaned me the copy to read. It's a neat little mystery. I like a good whodunit and this is definitely a good one. Sue Grafton has created a whole series around the lady detective that is the main character with a catchy alphabet theme....
      A fun novella about Yelena and Valeki stopping a plot to steal the Ice Moon. Short, but provides some good back story for Shadow Study.
      Good practical advice.
      Love this timeless book. plus being in Boston makes it extra special.
      A quick, fun read. Math content area connections - maybe not strong enough to use the whole novel in class, but a chapter might make for a good in-class read. Themes of bullying.
      The Key To Midnight<br />I don't have much against this book.. only that it's not really my type of book. Espionage just isn't my thing. Although, the base story was very well thought out.<br />I also read at the end of the book that Koontz had written different parts of the novel at different times and you...

      It’s a Melissa Foster book and it’s Duke Ryder! That is all I should have to say for this review. <br />You need to read this book! I fell in love right from the get go. Duke is everything that I dreamed him to be. I have been waiting for what seems like forever for his HEA. He is such a compassionate,...
      Gorgeous. Real. Hilarious and heartrending.

The three of them go to a cabin in the woods to explore the new relationship that Andie is in need of. They hold Andie a...
      <strong>Requested nightly</strong><br /><br />My three-year-old has requested this book every night this week. He likes the art and silly story. What a great bargain.
      <strong>Really enjoyed this book</strong><br /><br />I read this book while on vacation--coincidentally--in San Francisco. I was actually in Stinson Beach &amp; Muir Woods the same day I read those parts. Anyway, I still enjoyed the story and the way it came full circle.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />This was a very good read. Why did Terrance come BBC back and try to kill Madison? He was obviously gay. What was his motive? Did the dad and the doctor take it to the next level in their relationship? Did Room and Madison work through her issues? There were a lot of unanswered questions...
      Saw this at B&amp;N like two seconds ago and thought it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Also, it takes place on a ship. What more could you ask for
      First of all, let me say that I love the Bayou Billionaires. I've read the first two books and loved each. They are sexy and fun. Of course, I have read other books by authors of these books, so I knew that these were going to be great.<br /><br />Now, I have to comment on the hot guy on the cover. Ooo La La...
      <strong>Great read</strong><br /><br />If you've ever wanted something that was probably unattainable and hoped it would come to fruition. Then this book is for you. Well written and a joy to read. The characters dance a dance of uncertainty that finally resolves itself. You'll love Jake and Russ. But the young character wil...
      review coming soon!
      <strong>Dancers Heart</strong><br /><br />Wilde Creek is one of my favorite places to read about, so many good things happen there. Also alot of exciting things happen to. Lots of Wolves willing to kick some backsides to keep their mates safe. Amazing story, I can't wait to see what happens next.
      The book "boy in striped pajamas" was a very good read. You see the wars through eyes of children who were often overlooked. You also see it through two different perspectives, Bruno the son of a elite German army general and shule a Jewish boy whose father was a a watchmaker. There friendship gr...

      Reviewed for Nerdy, Dirty &amp; Flirty. Review to come.
      <strong>This is some of the best dialogue and character writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. </strong><br /><br />This was a thoroughly fun book. The dialogue mixed with extremely clever albeit darker spins on classic fairytales kept me turning page after page. Anyone who loves fantasy does a great disservice to...

      <strong>Known hacks but simplicity helped</strong><br /><br />I knew most of the hacks given and actually use some on a day to day basis but the simplicity that they were written with made the rest of them seem possible. I left the corporate world to be a SAHM and struggle daily. I came across this while looking for somethin...
      I really loved the characters in this book. I liked how they both liked and wanted each other but were separated by realistic problems. I loved that this book mostly took place in a small room...a "locked box" basically. Would definitely read another by this author.
      Terrible. Just inconceivably bad. And I love Jennifer Egan. Don't get me wrong. The last 20 pages of this book were lovely, though.
      <strong>So much love &amp; sincerity </strong><br /><br />This was a great, nerdy, awkward coming-of-age romance. The struggles with money, making choices you don't want to because you think "it's for the best", trying to not ask for help &amp; finally doing it...this book has a lot of heart &amp; feels very genuine. <br /><br />All 3 b...
      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I've been looking for a book like this without even realizing it. Truly put many things in perspective for me a has given me a plan for going forward.
      Wonderful book about love, truth, trust, betrayal and friendship. LOST WITHOUT YOU was written in a unique style. Hope Winters and Raphael Lacroix, known to his friends as Rafe, are the two main characters. The book focuses on their love story and tells the story from each of their perspective. I...
      LOVE!!!!!!!
      First read this in college, forty years ago. Was good to read it again. Age gives a different view.
      I remember reading this book right before the movie came out. It started off great but the author did very little world building and character progression. such a boring and disturbing read.
      <strong>A beautiful, tragic, heart breaking yet utterly gripping story. "It's Perfect"</strong><br /><br />The only thing that works here is this quote by Joanne Harris, "some books you read. some books you enjoy but some books just swallow you up, heart and soul.”<br /><br />I'm not sure I won't feel the need to close my eyes and breat...
      <strong>Travels with Bill</strong><br /><br />This is a funny, daydreamy wander of a book, a trip back to 1990 Europe. Bryson retraces a 1970 trip and reflects on the changes in those twenty years. I'd love to read about a redo of this redo--in 2016, are there now Pizza Huts in Sofia?
      <strong>Loved these stories. Sweet quick reads with characters you can relate too</strong><br /><br />Three well developed HEA stories that compliment each other. Will definitely read more from this author! A great set of stories for anyone.
      What the fuck? Is good I like it, it's something refreshing so to speak, is not your usual novel, so it's makes you think
      I really enjoyed this book! I felt like I was part of the story.
      Gorgeous, dark, and creepy - a real fairy tale. No, it's not an "anti-fairy tale" - whoever says that doesn't know what fairy tales are really like. There's plenty of spoilery reviews if you want to learn more. I really enjoyed it.
      <strong>Beautiful</strong><br /><br />This was truly a beautiful book and I wouldn't complain about it. It made me happy and sad but my heart felt so happy in the end. I got the exact story I wanted and I loved it. I hope everyone who reads this loves it as much as I did.
      <strong>Wow</strong><br /><br />A great book!! I lot different than other books ive read. I would highly recommend this book if you like a cliffhanger.
      Aahhhhh! <br />I seriously want to scream from the rooftops how much I loved this book.<br />I was pleasantly surprised this book had a teacher/student spin to it! It just made the book that much more for me!<br />And that just knocked me out!<br /><br />Finn and Brantley just took me by surprise. The way this story unfolded!...
       <br /> "This is a very special book; read with the greatest respect." <br />
      This was a great sequel.

      Amazing, highly recommend.
      Between Sade's of Gray was not an easy read but it was a worthy read. It opened up a part of history I was previously unfamiliar with. I would recommend it for people interested in historical fiction.
      I think Malcolm is running out of big ideas. This is basically a collection of magazine articles about how different people became successful. A lot of them are pretty interesting, but when he tries to stretch small observations into big points about the world, it often strains credulity.
      For the genre, this book peeked my interest and many have said this book is better than the Da Vinci Code. The author knows how to tell a story and take his readers on a great ride."
      Quinn is a funny, loves to cook in his free time, geeky, puts others first type of guy. He has had a crush on his next door neighbor for the past year. He finally formally introduced himself to Spencer after Spencer was shot when him and his SWAT team raided a home.<br /><br />It is a disaster of a first mee...
      Instantly draws you in and doesn't release it's grip to the final page. Well written. No need to 'get into the story' because the moment you open the book you become the characters.

The island is just off the coast of South Carolina. Gabriella grew up on the island and loves...
      A wonderful introduction to Tremontaine. It breaks my heart that I can't currently afford to buy the rest.
      Good naturalist book for young ones. Pictures and descriptions show the shapes of various trees without leaves plus a few winter animals. He last couple pages contrast a few evergreens. One star deducted because the word rhyming felt forced being read aloud and detracted from the enjoyment.
      A typical Neels book. You know what's going to happen as soon as the heroine says she would only drive to the cottage in the direst circumstances. The one thing I liked though was the hints about what the hero was feeling.
      The story of Benedict and Charlotte, and their relationship, grows throughout the entire story. Both are overcoming obstacles, but are on the same treasure hunting mission, which is what has brought them together. There are enough different elements throughout the story to keep the reader engaged...
      Incredible, absolutely incredible. Okay, so for the first part of this book, I thought it was going to be pretty predictable. Some parts were a little roughly written, but I loved the chemistry between Jake and Holly, their relationship was fun to read, and I was pretty bummed on what happened. T...
      <strong>Great story as always</strong><br /><br />This story was awesome, I wish there was more to it and I hope the next one comes out soon.
      Good!<br />

      A.L. Jackson writes books that feel more like poetry or song lyrics. Her newest novel, Where Lightning Strikes is just another example of her exceptional writing.

      remarkably accessible for a layman reading neuroscience. fascinating, frightening and functional
      <strong>Captivating</strong><br /><br />I wasn't sure where the book was going when I first started but I couldn't stop reading. Twists and turns. Amazing story.
      As a librarian, I’m naturally a bit obsessed with reference books, and in particular, horror reference books. When I was too young to see horror movies, I could still read books about them, and based on the plot description I would let my imagination do the work. For a good number of movies, I’m...

      Not well written and very basic.
      Hemingway continues to disappoint.

      <strong>More of the same</strong><br /><br />Stone Barrington is having a bit of a midlife crisis it would appear. It's the same group of characters and amusing enough but after some of the drama of Foreign Affairs this plodded just a bit.
      <strong>Loved this story! </strong><br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. Loved everything about it except it was too short! Hinted at something with Mattie's mother and dads story but never answered the question ...what happened. I would still highly recommend this story!
      This is a perfect first issue. What a set-up! What action?! A wonderful example of all the right ways to use panels and pictures to craft a story.
      Marty has published his debut horror novel “Tunnel of Doom” and has received some reviews he didn’t like. Marty is not your average author though. He’s part of an insane family that imprisons, tortures, and eats their victims. So, not one to let things lie, he goes on a road trip to confront the...
      This lovely read was so immensely engaging I finished it in one day! I love the characters in this novel and how they grow and how it all comes together in the end. Though this is mainly a romance, I enjoyed that in such a short novel the author managed to create believable characters with depth...
      Very charming! I love Hopper and Eni; tough kids who want to code = awesome! Very into it. Mike Holmes' cartoony style is a good fit for a book about basic coding. There were even a few twists I didn't predict! Looking forward to volume 2.
      LOVED IT SOOOOOOO MUCH!!!
      Amazing.

      It's a very interesting premise. The crimes are definitely brutal and awful. However, the writing reminds me of a high school student turning in an essay with a minimum word count. A lot could have been edited out.
      <strong>Love those Ouachitas!!!!</strong><br /><br />Each character in the series feels like an old friend. Ms. Jameson has written another most excellent book. I'm waiting impatiently for the next in the series. I can honestly say that I HIGHLY recommend not only this book, but all of P. Jameson's books. You won't be disapp...

      <strong>Great reading</strong><br /><br />I love all of Peggy Henderson books. Good clean romance with beautiful scenes. Western but not western. That make sense?
      Finn and Brantley will melt your heart. I am a huge fan of Ella Frank. Her Temptation Series is what got me hooked on m/m books. I also love a great second chance read. This book hit a two-for-one! This story was wonderful. The characters are very complex and mature. They are not out for the game...

      I really liked the protagonists in this one. I wish it hadn't ended with them trying to live in two places at once (especially because visiting her house puts him in danger every time), but other than that it was a very good story.
      This was an incredible book. It flowed so seamlessly that if it hadn’t been for the author’s name on the chapter, you would think it was written by one author instead of such a large group. Each author definitely left their mark on Verity and Hudson. Verity is hilarious. Her first impression of H...

      It was ok. These stories all seem to be really short and so I feel like we miss out on a lot of what could happen. I don't know.. It was good.. I just wish we could get more story!
      a great thriller right to the end!

      I enjoyed this book and this series. The author built a detailed character of the heroine, and the others involved were well described as well. The locations of the story were clear and well-described.
      <strong>This book was just awesome.</strong><br /><br />This book book pulled so many emotions out of me and I couldn't put it down. The love between the two characters was beautiful. What a love story. I cried so much through this story. It was brilliant. A must read!!!

And it only burns hotter. Until da...

      The Danger in Bohemia is a first time reading author H.E. Kollef for me, and the book was excellent.

      Great story.. Looking forward to reading more from this author
      Ugh! A literary masterpiece????? I think not!!!
      I loved this book. It was so cute. Some of the things the boys do to her are embarassing/awful and the crap she has to put up with in dealing with Evan's girlfriend is horrible. It was such a fast read; I couldn't put it down.
      We all know that the best part of life comes AFTER the HEA. I loved that this book was all about making a relationship work- not just meeting your dream partner. Malcolm is so used to setting a goal, and working his way towards it, that he is becoming a workaholic. Kylie is so afraid of becoming...

      Could hardly finish this. Only one of the series I read. Too many characters. So not interesting.
      Note to the author: one does not simply mix the Italian mafia, animal shape-shifting humans, star-crossed lovers and a pubescent dialogue into a book. The result is horrendous.

      I need this now
      Adventure...fun read
      3.5 A pretty quick read. I liked how the author went back and forth between present day &amp; the past with things slowly coming together. Plenty of good themes for a good book club discussion.

      good book. loosely based on biblical story. Enjoyed much. Highly recommend, good story line, lots of twists/action, little strange/comfortable beginning
      I'm a fan of everything Brandon Mull writes and recently started on the Five Kingdoms series. His books are full of humor (especially teenage comebacks), tension, and interesting plots. I liked Fablehaven better than this, but this was better than Beyonders in my opinion. The story is about some...
      A great read. The premise of the book is pretty humorous. Looking forward to watching the 1959 movie.
      ** ARC PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR FOR AN HONEST REVIEW ** <br /><br />OK first of all I have to say I'm in love. Elizabeth Brown is a gifted writer. This book was very well written. And can easily be a favorite. When reading feels like it's speaking directly to you. It has everything a book lover could want it's...
      Like an eight year old, I find books about underwear hilarious. The deal was sealed for my library to order our own copy when my children's programmer borrowed it from another library and read it at story time -- to hear a group of children yell "Underwear" in the library is pretty hysterical.
      I very much enjoyed this one more over the 1st book. I was drenched in reading this one from the moment i picked it up.
      Great book if you want to know your personality type and then be blown away when you realize some of the motivations behind the things you do. But the importance of this book is when it is used as a tool for personal growth.

      <strong>Obedience at its best</strong><br /><br />I am in love with this book. Halfway through I bought a copy for a friend and have recommended to numerous people. This book has opened my eyes tremendously and brought me closer to God than ever before. I'm beyond blessed to have been given the opportunity to read and study...
      <strong>Cool</strong><br /><br />Love the second part this this book I like the fact that it's gone to the mans point of view on what he's been doing . I also like the fact that they explained his back history.
      <strong>Good Quick Read</strong><br /><br />This novella is a fun read on a snow day. People who enjoy Odd Thomas will enjoy this,<br /> pet lovers also.<br />
      <strong>Fabulous </strong><br /><br />I have now read all three of these book and loved them all .<br /> I would have love more interference by Eric family but so happy they got to have there happy ever after
      <strong>Another hit</strong><br /><br />I have read everyone in this series and this is another great one. Hot drool worthy hawk has stole my heart. The history hawk and Val went through and had breaks my heart. I totally loved Val's dad. Glad he was getting happy news to. In the end I love how these two worked through the p...
      This book, the third book in the Dido Kent series, is by far stronger than the first two. I almost gave up on the series, but now I am glad that I persevered.
      A lovely little epilogue to All You Need is Love, which was available to read on Marie Force's website. It showed Will and Cameron packing up her things in NY and we got to meet her father and friends a bit more.
      Title seemed silly and a few of the early conversations with secondary characters felt stilted, but other than that, it rocked. Hot and steamy!
      The Study of Seduction by Sabrina Jeffries was engaging book from the first chapter to the last. I enjoyed the banter between Edwin and Clarissa, it truly made the book great. I am new to Sabrina Jeffries and this book made me a fan. I liked how Edwin was able to share an interest with Clarissa t...
      So smart!! Jeez.

      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />Good storyline that kept me engaged the whole time. No slow parts. Can't wait to read the next one in the series!
      A wonderful book about LGQT culture in Athens :)<br /><br />But for real, this is an extraordinarily influential dialogue and gave me great insight into Socrates/Plato. Excited to read some more soon.
      Too many names to keep track of and the romance between the two main characters was hard to believe.
      This book's story and illustrations are so great. It really captures a young girl's passion for dance, as well as the hope that springs eternal for children with dreams of greatness.
      Great mystery................as only Agatha can do!
      4.5
      <strong>LOVE THIS BOOK</strong><br /><br />Love this series. The adventure and mystery of the story keep me wanting more.Can't wait to read what happens next.
      Thrilled that the author wrote this book about spinning faux-postivie into everything and anyone. Please get out of denial and grab a healthy dose of reality because it is important to see things for what they are. Sincere thank you to the author.
      <strong>Out of the park</strong><br /><br />Marie James did it again. I fell in love with Kincaid right from the start. The story is very believable as a few biker clubs are family like this one. Pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.
      This book has some good useful tips. I like that there was some very practical steps to follow. The idea of buckets is a great idea - much more organized then what I currently have. She shares a lot about social media and which one(s) might be your best options as an author. There was also some g...
      Many great moments occasionally ruined by long, irrelevant digressions about magic. Some careless POV shifts. Some memorable characters and scenes.

      <strong>Easter Bear</strong><br /><br />Loved the Easter Bunny Bear book. Lol it was a fun book with a touch of love and adventure. I have enjoyed all your books Zoe you have a great talent.
      4.5 rating. love this author -- a must read.
      Loved how Genie didn't let her honeymoon go to waste especially after what Ross did to her loved how Donnie took his mom's advice and asked her out. Great love story.
      Such a beautiful book. So hard to read though. Called up some pretty horrific events in history with the Rwandan genocide. Favorite quote that induced some deep thoughts about forgiveness and Christ. <br /><br />"Something must have been looking out for Deo, and I disliked hearing the words in my mind. I sai...
      I'm guessing at the date; may have been in the 1970's. Very, very depressing. Excellent writing but I would never read another book by Malamud.
      Despite moments of beautiful writing, I did not enjoy the experience of reading this book.
      An amazing book about the lives if immigrants and what they go through. Loved that it was written in verse
      excellent read. An overview of life---look into the life of a husband and a wife through each setsof eyes. More feedback from the people who grew up in this town ----- uncomfortable, amusing and straightforward ----- llife.
      I couldn't finish it, I thought it was boring, it felt long even though technically it's not :(
      For a story about a wedding, there were only about 5 chapters about the wedding &amp; wedding prep out of 42 chapters.
      O
      This book was well-organized and informative. It contained great pictures and was easy-to-read, even for someone not really into cars.

      Watchmen is one of the most iconic graphic-novels for a reason. It features memorable characters, a unique story, and some food for thought as well. Comics don’t get much better than this.<br /><br />While I enjoy comics as much as the next guy, they are starting to get kind of formulaic. The villain has sim...

      Oh, FINALLY! I'm so glad all that's done. I think this would have been a great place to end it, but what do I know? Two more at least, so on to the next one!
      <strong>The trilogy was interesting and pretty well written, BUT</strong><br /><br />It should have all been in one book. I will not be buying any further books by Sierra Rose because I believe this marketing ploy is cheating and unethical
      We have this rule in effect and it is AMAZING.

      I'll have to read this many more times in order to fully understand it, but the first read through was still great.
      <strong>Keeps you on edge</strong><br /><br />I had a hard time putting this one down. It kept me in suspense and guessing at all times. Although some parts seemed a little farfetched, it was still a good read.
      awesome!
      <strong>Whew! What a trip!</strong><br /><br />This is an informative, concise, delightful book. I loved learning some facts about this country by "visiting it". Great concept. Great illustrations and photos!<br />

      Simply opening Locomotive by Brain Floca is a real treat, the book is filled with illustrations, maps, different fonts, and labeled parts of trains. I think that a picture walk of this book, would interest most kids, even with the length. Due to the length of this book, I’m unsure of how I would...
      <strong>Wow!</strong><br /><br />If you are going to read any book this year, let it be this one. I could only put it down when I was driving. What an inspirational story of a family with so many strikes against them! But, God is good (all the time!) G. Eric Francis takes you right into the everyday life of being with Noah....
      Her Finest Hour by Stephen Doster is the best gift a son could give his mother, a memorial of her life; one that women and men should honor.

      <strong>This is now one of my "must read" authors</strong><br /><br />Wow! I hope a lot of people read Aric Davis's books. He is different, and he is good.

      Legal novel - Nate O'Riley travels to the backcountry of Brazil to locate the illegitimate, missionary daughter of a multi-billionaire who commits suicide after leaving her his fortune and disinheriting his six legitimate children.
      This book is exquisite. It is not the same as the film of the same name, which lacks something in the directorship (acting is stunning).
      I read this as a little girl, re-read it to my oldest son, and just finished reading it to my youngest son. he book is very funny and imaginative. Inspires the kids to read more.
      Witches really are a detestable breed. They disguise themselves as lovely ladies, when secretly they want to squish and squelch all the wretched children they despise. Luckily one boy and his grandmother know how to recognize these vile creatures, but can they get rid of them for good?
      I'm stopping this book. Too depressing. I hate downward spirals where the characters do bad things for no good reason &amp; just keep going down.
