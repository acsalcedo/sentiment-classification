      Of the 11 short stories in this collection, there were only two that I considered good and did not regret Protocol A235 and 2092. The rest were not worth the read. Glad I didn’t pay anything for this.",negative

      I listened to the audiobook, which is the best thing about this book. Hearing Kate Mulgrew speak is magical. But content didn't seem ""deep"" enough, despite some pretty huge life changes.

      Pretty spare storywise. I understand that this is meant to be the start of the series but you have to compel me to want to read more. As it stands, I wasn't particularly interested in any of the characters and the supposed mean girl was defeated way too easily.",negative
"
      Did not finish this one. The story was choppy and I disliked the characters.",negative

      The concept was intriguing but the story felt too simplistic, as if the author ran out of ideas after the initial good one. The characters were flat and cliched.",negative

      While I did really enjoy the concept of the book, I agree with other reviewers in that the art really let it down.
