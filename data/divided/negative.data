      All three books were funny and romantic. About 3 brothers who were construction workers and got married to 3 friends.
      Book Club Pick! Loved picking up with these same loved characters. The therapy group was a beautiful way to depict all kinds of grief.
      Book club pick! Loved the characters. Quirky and fun. Get your tissues ready!
      With it's premise of an elf woman hunting down incubi in order to pay for her daughter's ransom, this story had a lot of promise. Even though I was bombarded and almost stoned to death by the dreaded NOT SEXY c**k and p***y words, Carmen and Blaze's mutual attraction was steamy. While I thought t...
      <strong>Oh man</strong><br /><br />I never want this series to end. Loved the flashback and seeing the lives they had before we met them in romeo's book. Can't wait for the next one!!
      zora neale hurstaw their eyes were watching god
      Very bad book.
      Just a very bad novel.
      I enjoyed this whole series thoroughly! I highly recommend this book to other readers. It's a great read!
      I have read many books by Dean Koontz , some of them were excellent and some were not very good. “Ashely Bell” is in the latter category. It started very strong, Bibi Blair a young inspiring writer is stricken with a nasty cancer, she is determine to beat it ( against all odds), her family and fr...
      The hunger Game is series is just awesome. Probably one of the best series ever. When reading this book the reader might feel as this has happened to them before. The tension in this book is real, Katniss and Gale are thinking about running away. However it then turns in an argument, so Gale leav...
      Of the 11 short stories in this collection, there were only two that I considered good and did not regret Protocol A235 and 2092. The rest were not worth the read. Glad I didn’t pay anything for this.
      I listened to the audiobook, which is the best thing about this book. Hearing Kate Mulgrew speak is magical. But content didn't seem "deep" enough, despite some pretty huge life changes. Then, it just ended. Not bad, not great...but definitely a pleasure to hear Mulgrew's own voice tell her tale....
      <strong>Amish Young Love</strong><br /><br />I have recently had to read to help relax for bed and to get to sleep these stories are prefect
      <strong>WOW !</strong><br /><br />I like reading a good book when it's just that .... a good book....<br />I looked forward to opening my kindle each time. The story definitely keeps you guessing about her true identity.... then when you finish the vook
      Not enough of a story.
      One of my favorite Comics, such a good story, fantasic art and great characters, definitely a should read
      <strong>Boring !</strong><br /><br />I can not believe that I read the whole thing. It moves so slow. I kept thinking that it would be better as I read along but it just got worse. I have read several books with the same story. Don't bother wasting your time.
      4th book in the Mistress of the Art of Death series. Upsetting ending to the series with too many unanswered questions because of the death of the author. Hoping her daughter continues Adelia's story.
      Waiting to read.
      Third book in the Mistress of the Art of Death series. Adelia and Mansur are still serving under King Henry II and getting into more trouble.
      Pretty spare storywise. I understand that this is meant to be the start of the series but you have to compel me to want to read more. As it stands, I wasn't particularly interested in any of the characters and the supposed mean girl was defeated way too easily.
      Did not finish this one. The story was choppy and I disliked the characters.
      The concept was intriguing but the story felt too simplistic, as if the author ran out of ideas after the initial good one. The characters were flat and cliched.
      This book only has one word throughout the entire book, ball. It is about a dog who wants different members of the family to play ball with it, and portrays what goes on in a dogs mind.
      I wanted to like this book, but it reminded me of those condescending books written for children that talk about bullying or drugs. It had some good information, but it was too simplistic, and the situations they described were too neat, and too perfect.
      Liked the text, illustrations not my favorite.
      Story is funny. Illustrations, just okay.

      I find it difficult to understand why people like these books. The story here depends on the feasibility of a technology which very few of us are expert enough to have an opinion on. A major part of the plot makes no sense, and the relationship between Scarpetta and Benton in the course of the da...
      I read this thirty years ago and now with a son who is a medical student I revisited it. Still true in parts and still made me laugh.
      Lolz?

      Not sure that whole thing at the bottom was necessary, but the artwork is very pretty and the story is very nice.
      This was actually a really good book. I think a lot of invisible kids will see themselves in this book, and maybe kids can use it to see how it only takes one person to make a kid feel seen and not left out.
      Colección La Historia en Historietas, tomo dedicado a Vuelta de Obligado y El Quebracho.
      <strong>3.5 Stars</strong><br /><br />It is a well written book worth reading, albeit being too whiny and unnecessarily wordy at times. With flourishing language and biting sarcasm, the author does a commendable job demonstrating the ambiguity of morality and the utter irony of the human condition; I was specially touched by...

      Ehh... no.
      A slow and vanilla cash in on the Travelling Pants books. It took me until about about halfway through to feel involved with the characters and even then I wasn't all that interested in the outcome of their stories.
      DNF. Just not for me.
      Mama read this to me today. I liked pointing out the "Bear" on each page. Very cute book.
      Mama read this to me today. I loved all of the elements on the endpapers best, but it's a really good book overall.
      It took me weeks to get through this. I wasn't compelled to read yet I still wanted to know what happened. Ultimately though, I found the writing style a bit pretentious and although the characters did ring true, I didn't really like them much.
      1.5 <br /><br />Felt like I was reading fan fiction or a Wattpad story. Not my style, sorry.

      I'm always wary when an older comedian/comedy writer/comedy actor releases a book about aging. Everyone knows what the jokes will be about, and the reader gets exactly what they expect. Nevertheless, I love to listen to celebrity memoirs in my car during my commute. The first half of this book wa...
      A cute coffe table book. I like what the photographer stands for. I would've preferred if it had bios of the dogs, especially the adoptable ones. Maybe the owners too, their family story. There was a dog named Sadie, which shouldn't have surprised me but it did &amp; that ruined my enjoyment of t...
      There's a lot of artistic young woman passion here, which I can completely appreciate. I desperately wanted to love this book in its entirety; sad to say I lost interest more than halfway through it.
      Anyone else remember this author?
      While I did really enjoy the concept of the book, I agree with other reviewers in that the art really let it down. It was hard to work out what was going on at times and a lot of the male characters were indistinguishable from each other. I think it would have been of great benefit to use colour...
      *book club book*
      This book really emphasizes how people can feel out of place in their family and end up leaving. It takes leaving to figure out what you really had in life, and this book is the perfect way to teach that to to young kids.
      Leggendo la trama di questo libro mi sono subito sentita attirata e affascinata dal tipo di storia a cui sarei andata incontro con questa lettura e la mia curiosità è stata placata presto, poichè ho acquistato questo libro pochissimo tempo fa e ho deciso di leggerlo.

      2016-2017 Truman Final Nominee
      This is a retelling of the Pygmalion story or if you are not familiar with that, “My Fair Lady”. It follows so closely to that story line that I almost started to sing “The rain In Spain, stays mainly in the plain”. Lucia is a woman who is scorned by her family for not living up to the family expectations.
      <strong>TO MANY RUN ON SENTENCES!</strong><br /><br />Go back to school, to learn how to write correctly, or get a very good editor.

      The beginning was good. Middle was...mediocre. Found the horror idea lame. Skimmed to the end. Not worth the time.

      This is only delicious if you really enjoy the taste of cliches.
      it's amazing book
      "You can't have a romantic relationship if you can't touch your partner" is basically what Juliette is teaching young readers in this book. Great job.
      I'm not sure I even know where to start with this book. One of the biggest complaints I’ve read about this book are the romantic interests. Main character shows interest in two people. Honestly, this doesn't bother me much most of the time in books; it’s teenagers. High Schoolers tend to ‘crush’...

      The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a book about the American life during the 1920s.

      DNF. Narration was crap..
      A horrid little book. I refuse to finish.
      Listening to on Scribd. Narrated by Kate Bolick
      I hated it.
      Great read, could not put it down.
      This isn't a bad book nor is it poorly written. It was cute. But nothing in me believes that this is a read for Young Adults or Adults reading Young Adult; it is more for middle schoolers.
      I am torn between not liking this book and thinking it was ok. My main problem with this was not the involvement of God, but the writing. I am a huge fan of writing styles, and this did not have any to begin with. If an author goes with a first person narration, s/he needs to make sure that the v...

      Disappointingly shallow treatment of the subject.
      As a fantasy fanatic, I knew I had to have this book and I have to say anyone who prides themselves on being a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's work really should at least give this book a look. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Getting to look at the maps and see where the characters I grew up wit...
      <strong>What</strong><br /><br />Sorry, I didn't like this story at all. The storyline was bad and I didn't like the characters. The heroine cried through the entire story and the hero's wife was crazy.
      This book should be subtitled Sarah Harding saves the motherf***ing day
      To me, this series with all of the novellas is dragging on too long. I don't mind getting a peek inside their HEA during a novel with a new H/h...but to keep having novellas with the same characters is too much.
      <strong>Boring</strong><br /><br />I could not read half way through it . but I want dairy of a angry Alex 10 please .
      this was very good. the relationship and tension was emotional.
      It was okay, certainly not fantastic.
      I enjoyed the book. Emaline learns that not everything is going to be perfect and to accept changes. As she has a chaotic summer, she's going into college at East U. I recommend this to any girl who is learning about life and changes and how to deal with them.
      <strong>Propelling</strong><br /><br />I read this book without putting it down.

      GREAT
      This book has no merit at all. Why it us selected for any purpose by anyone us beyond me.
      Fuck this book. No one read it. The first story was annoying, the second story was sexist and offensive and the third story's protagonist was so unlikable that I was rooting for her to be unhappy. Seriously, don't read this piece of trash.
      Are you interested in what a 50-year-old man thinks about wikileaks? How about what he thinks about the sexuality of millennial women?

      This was possibly the strangest book I have ever read. There were a few great quotes but mostly, this one fell flat for me.
      I’m not overly excited about this one. My university lecturer wants us to take notes when we read this, and come to a conclusion whether or not we think the author was a racist.

      Starts with so much potential, but about 2/3rds of the way through it becomes repetitive and characters start behaving in inconsistent ways, or just ignoring or not using the great powers they were said to have earlier.<br /><br />It reads like a standard YA novel with some "grown up" bits tossed in. And rep...

      Read during my boarding school obsession ca. age ten, and forgotten until recently.
      An inspiring book I keep coming back to whenever I doubt or am scared or worried about anything. You always find answers and encouragements in it! Thank you President Ikeda!
      This was a good picture book about expectations. Each of the characters on the window sill is waiting for their favorite time of year or day. They sit and watch and wait together for that to come.
      Loved this book!
      Bad book.
      I did not enjoy this book.
      It went on too long for me.
      This is an interactive book, and great for kids who are learning how to count.
      This book is about a man who was a former slave who now works as a potter making beautiful clay vases and dishes.
      Disappointingly appropriative at best. Seemed to be attempting to critique orientalism and racism in fantasy, but often ended up perpetuating. Pratchett occasionally fails in this manner in other books, but none (that I have so far read) so wholly.
      While I like the idea of taking about prayer and spiritual warfare, this book wasn't practical enough for me. It was broken down into 10 part of your life the enemy likes to attack. It just got a little monotonous.
      It was a good read, finished it in 3 days
      the book was alright.
      I was very disappointed in this book.<br /><br />It did not live up to the promise that was raised by "the poor mouth" (definitely a 5 star book). This book is highly experimental (other reviewers have likened it to Ulysses - or, worse still, Finnegan's Wake - and their ilk).<br /><br />Clearly the writer is clever, but...

      Jeramiah finding a way
      This is basically a romance between an older man and a younger woman, the norm for this time period.
      These books are increasingly poorly written, descending into gratuitous violence and lack of plot. I kind of enjoyed the first novel, but after the escape from the maze it lost direction, credibility, and, frankly, interest.
      One of my favorites - loved the entire triology!
      When I am in the right mood, I plan to read this. Not a fan of deceased spouse tropes, but this storyline still appeals to me.
      So disappointing compared to #1!

      Horrible!
      Bad book
      Well, I guess that I am crazy because this book of stories didn’t bowl me over as I expected and as it did most everyone else. It is not the darkness of them. I enjoy a gothic twist. A Good Man Is Hard To Find, the first story, lured me in a bit but the stories went down from there. Neither the c...
      It is an interesting little book about relationships. I might be too young to understand some of them but it is portraying common situations and talks that we experience. Mostly how we avoid answering questions and how we destroy ourself by creating problems.

      I read the updated version. One of the better homeschooling books I have read. Great things to ponder in here on what homeschooling should really be about.

      I really loved the characters in this book. I liked how they both liked and wanted each other but were separated by realistic problems. I loved that this book mostly took place in a small room...a "locked box" basically. Would definitely read another by this author.
      Terrible. Just inconceivably bad. And I love Jennifer Egan. Don't get me wrong. The last 20 pages of this book were lovely, though.
      I remember reading this book right before the movie came out. It started off great but the author did very little world building and character progression. such a boring and disturbing read.
      <strong>A beautiful, tragic, heart breaking yet utterly gripping story. "It's Perfect"</strong><br /><br />The only thing that works here is this quote by Joanne Harris, "some books you read. some books you enjoy but some books just swallow you up, heart and soul.”<br /><br />I'm not sure I won't feel the need to close my eyes and breat...
      Like other reviews have said, By Light Alone is a great premise that's ruined by a poorly told story. Although “story” is a bit misleading since there's effectively two or three separate story threads here that are then forced together in order to justify a novel. <br /><br />By Light Alone is set in a world...
      I think Malcolm is running out of big ideas. This is basically a collection of magazine articles about how different people became successful. A lot of them are pretty interesting, but when he tries to stretch small observations into big points about the world, it often strains credulity.
      formulaic
      It had a good premise, but fell short. I didn't care for the ending at all!
      I like her books. The characters are very loveable. Give me a good fun and frothy read at this time of the year!
      somewhat lame.
      dnf at 40% <br />couldn't keep reading this one. too boring &amp; not really my thing.

      I really liked the first book in the series however books 2 and 3 were just okay. The characters in this book were okay but kind of weak to me. The over all story had promise but just seemed to lack something. Which just let the book being okay to me.<br /><br />-- -- Gifted ARC copy -- --<br />L.
      Simple but so cute! (*3*)
      Classic Coben.
      Good!<br />
      Boring beginning. Boring middle. Pretty good ending.
      Couldn't even finish it. I think the first chapter or so would have been enough to explain who he was, what happened to him after the assassination. Just not interesting enough to finish and I love historical fiction/non-fiction.
      Loved this book - will definitely read more of this author's books
      ***ARC Provided by the author and NetGalley***<br /><br />I wanted to like this. The cover and storyline in the blurb appealed to me. I liked that Greyson was 39, as the heroes in books seem to always be 28-32. I liked that Blaise was a florist. But, I did not like it. When I give a really low rating/review,...
      Need to reread this some day.
      Not well written and very basic.
      Hemingway continues to disappoint.
      <strong>More of the same</strong><br /><br />Stone Barrington is having a bit of a midlife crisis it would appear. It's the same group of characters and amusing enough but after some of the drama of Foreign Affairs this plodded just a bit.
      Terrible.
      sad and amazing at the same time
      <strong>Wow!</strong><br /><br />This is a stunning book. Cal and Mare are fighting for more than their lives in this book. There are sacrifices and bargains and enough action to keep the story moving. I can't wait to see what the conclusion will bring.
      I agree with other reviewers that this book just does not measure up to her previous titles. Not that a Tori Spelling book is necessarily a literary masterpiece, but the others had a theme and she spoke in a more genuine, open, honest way. This book felt like you were in an uncomfortable room wit...
      The book Opposites was about opposites. On one page there would be say fast and slow, or big and tall comparing the opposites. There were great illustration to go with each opposite. This would be a great book to include in a lesson about comparisons or opposites for younger children.
      The final book in the series is alternately narrated by Grace, Greer and Gretchen, the triplet descendants of the mythical gorgons.<br />I would have liked more references to the ancient Greek myths. I also believe it might have worked better as a satire.
      Light and humorous. This book shows the intense bond between triplet women in their 30's.
      I definitely preferred Schlink's book "Der Vorleser."
      It's a very interesting premise. The crimes are definitely brutal and awful. However, the writing reminds me of a high school student turning in an essay with a minimum word count. A lot could have been edited out.
      It sucked.
      read for children's literature class
      <strong>A STRANGE AND GRUESOME STORY</strong><br /><br />There is little merit to this tale. It is inconclusive and not worth spending time on. It has no redeeming qualities. I do not recommend it.
      <br />رواية وردة عيسى رواية تجسد مستوى التناحر والدمار الذي ساد عالمنا وكله لسبب الإيدولوجيات والأفكار الدينية والسياسية ، تحكي الرواية قصة فتى مسلم ولد في كنيسة اثناء زيارة لأمه هناك وأطلق عليه اسم عيسى ولكنه سيواجه المثير من المشاكل بسبب هذا الأسم وبسبب ولادته في الكنيسة.

      Great Book
      Couldn't get into it.
      I did not like.

      I was super excited about this book. Unfortunately I think it made my expectations too high. Guinevere wanted to be a very strong character but she seems very weak. I would think that with all the stories there are of her she would be a lot more confident.
      coudnt finish it...i dont understand why everyone loves this book so much.
      2016-2017 Truman Final Nominee
      It was ok. These stories all seem to be really short and so I feel like we miss out on a lot of what could happen. I don't know.. It was good.. I just wish we could get more story!
      <strong>Waste of time and money</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm not going to give this book a single star. Complete waste of time. Nothing in here useful and the book is only a 2 minute read at most. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      I'm not a giant Tori Spelling fan, but I don't dislike her either and a friend recommended her books as perfect, light material for me to read while recuperating from surgery and this book totally delivers. Tori just seems very genuine and admits a lot about her foibles and upscale preferences, b...
      I liked the first book in the series, but this one was not such a good story. I didn't feel like the situation was believable. There were also many grammatical/typing mistakes in the beginning of the book which always distracts me. It needed better editing.
      this story didn't appeal to me. the topic and premise were fine, but the writing didn't work for me.
      this book is so quickly to read I get done fast
      <strong>Ok book</strong><br /><br />That was the shortest book I believe I have ever read. I was sitting down thinking this was going to be a long book, I had the whole thing done in less than an hour. Really glad I didn't buy this book!

      This book is very geared towards mothers, which thankfully I'm not.
      <strong>Ridiculous</strong><br /><br />I can't believe this is the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird. There's no story here at all. Really juvenile.
      How many times to people have to say that communication is key? Not annoyed, just bored.
      <strong>Important subject matter but a frustrating read</strong><br /><br />I am glad the author wrote this book because we need to remember the atrocities that happened in Germany, but the story was frustrating to read. The first half was quite long and detailed, and the last few chapters left out the details I'd been waiti...
      Terrible, unhelpful, poor writing, awful format, scrapped-together piece of a book. If you want some real advice and something helpful, don't waste your time with this.
      a very long history

      Similar to Modesitt's Imager's portfolio, he has simply re-written the first three books a few thousand years in the past. The protagonist is identical to that of every other one of his novels. The first three books were enjoyable, stop here and come back and read the remaining books once the fir...
      Full disclosure: Got 150 pages into it and was bored to tears. What am I missing!?
      I give up. This book is so slow and I can't relate to the opera stuff at all.
      Some decent writing appeared unexpectedly at points. Still pretty basic tho
      Could hardly finish this. Only one of the series I read. Too many characters. So not interesting.
      Note to the author: one does not simply mix the Italian mafia, animal shape-shifting humans, star-crossed lovers and a pubescent dialogue into a book. The result is horrendous.
      Entertaining
      LOVE IT SO FREAKIN' MUCH!
      Revolting serial cheater who can never keep it in his pants. While trying to show the h he loves her and wants only her, at THE SAME TIME, he is fucking all the club whores.

      Contrived rather unconvincingly. Motivations of the characters aren't always reasonable.
      Too many names to keep track of and the romance between the two main characters was hard to believe.
      Two legs bad. Four legs good.<br />If Donald Trump wins, don't say you weren't warned.
      Great collection of short essays by leading spiritual thinkers on the corporal and spiritual acts of mercy. A helpful meditation tool.
      Heartwarming.

      saddest book ever!
      I enjoyed these books.<br /><br />That does not mean I understood them at all.

      Excellent book, based on true events. Learned a lot &amp; enjoyed the writing and story.
      A fun, quick read. Looking forward to volume 2.
      Loved this cute story!!!! The love they have for each other is so sweet. One part had me laughing out loud but I won't spoil anything for anyone. Def. worth the read!
      <strong>I Read This as a Prequel</strong><br /><br />I haven't yet read The Wrath &amp; the Dawn. In fact, I've struggled with it, and I have put it down numerous times. I thought that reading this short story would pique my interest, and it has. I'm now curious to finish the novel.

      This is a short book compared to the books I usually read- around 220 pages long.

I wanted to read this after hearing abou...
      <strong>I like. </strong><br /><br />I really liked how different this book was. I can't imagine how they'll capture everything in the movie. This book has many twists and turns. I really enjoyed the author including "authentic" pictures. Nice touch! Can't wait to read the second!
      <em>On A Dark Wing</em> is a mostly forgettable drudge through a YA adaption of <em>Meet Joe Black</em>, with even less plot, less believable circumstances and less interesting characters. Return the several hours wasted on this book, please.
      good book

      This book was an interesting portrayal of the author's realization that although she planned to be a lawyer, she quickly realized she wanted to be less intense, more stay at home mum type. It could lead to some interesting conversations, but the book itself wasn't written that well.
      Meh ...
      4.25
      If it hadn’t been for all the 5 star reviews on here and on Amazon, I think I would have given up on this one. The first three quarters of the book are so slow and the characters are so repugnant (and confusingly similar) that even a half decent ending doesn’t excuse the tedious journey it takes...
      2.5. It was ok. Interesting to see how the author did MC for YA.
      I'm guessing at the date; may have been in the 1970's. Very, very depressing. Excellent writing but I would never read another book by Malamud.
      Despite moments of beautiful writing, I did not enjoy the experience of reading this book.
      I couldn't finish it, I thought it was boring, it felt long even though technically it's not :(

       Stopped at 51%. Not really keeping my interest at this point. Though, they are a very sweet couple and it's very, very low angst. Maybe that's the problem...no conflict of any type yet. I'll give it try later.
      For a story about a wedding, there were only about 5 chapters about the wedding &amp; wedding prep out of 42 chapters.
      Zero.
      Not interesting at all.
      <strong>The trilogy was interesting and pretty well written, BUT</strong><br /><br />It should have all been in one book. I will not be buying any further books by Sierra Rose because I believe this marketing ploy is cheating and unethical
      Disappointing book. Had so much potential, but it was just a chore to read. Great concept, great setting, so many great ideas. But just really dull and laboured. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't.
      2.5
      Witches really are a detestable breed. They disguise themselves as lovely ladies, when secretly they want to squish and squelch all the wretched children they despise. Luckily one boy and his grandmother know how to recognize these vile creatures, but can they get rid of them for good?
      I'm stopping this book. Too depressing. I hate downward spirals where the characters do bad things for no good reason &amp; just keep going down.
      Finally!! I've been wanting to read this for so long but couldn't find the physical copy anywhere and I'm too stubborn to read an ebook
      <strong>Bad</strong><br /><br />Who ever thought of a silver pickaxe it goes like would to stone stone to iron iron to gold and gold to diamond.

      You know from the beginning that this book ends in tragedy, yet you still cannot put this down.
      Letto alle elementari... forzatamente e svogliatamente. Ora capisco perchè lo facciano leggere, ma rimane una sorta di "trauma". Indipendentemente da come è scritto (suppongo bene visto il suo successo) io proprio non lo posso vedere. :(
