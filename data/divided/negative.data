      It is no secret that I'm a fan of this series. When I first noticed there would be a m/m story as we found out one of the Pack members found his mate in a human nurse at the compound, I was extremely giddy. Especially because he was rejecting the idea completely and I thought that would make for a good angsty story. And then we get PHOENIX REBORN. Which was just too..... simple. The story, the characters, it just all felt like a waste of a good base for a book! I started off liking both of them, but quickly realized Nix was going to annoy the crap out of me. A lot of his issues come from the homophobia he had to deal with from his father. And I'm sorry, after he's now turned into a big bad shifter, I can't get behind his way of thinking. And after a while, Noah's actions were also getting on my nerves. So basically I spent a lot of time while reading this book wanting to shake both characters! The one thing I did like was the tie in to the phoenix aspect and how the author was able to work that in. But other than that, this book has left me a bit disappointed. I'm not sure if I can say the author was comfortable writing a male/male couple. The dynamics between them didn't really work for me, and the sex got repetitive. As always though, this is a series I'll continue reading, even though sadly this one missed the mark for me.
      With it's premise of an elf woman hunting down incubi in order to pay for her daughter's ransom, this story had a lot of promise. Even though I was bombarded and almost stoned to death by the dreaded NOT SEXY c**k and p***y words, Carmen and Blaze's mutual attraction was steamy. While I thought t...
      Very bad book.
      Just a very bad novel.
      I have read many books by Dean Koontz , some of them were excellent and some were not very good. “Ashely Bell” is in the latter category. It started very strong, Bibi Blair a young inspiring writer is stricken with a nasty cancer, she is determine to beat it ( against all odds), her family and fr...
      Of the 11 short stories in this collection, there were only two that I considered good and did not regret Protocol A235 and 2092. The rest were not worth the read. Glad I didn’t pay anything for this.
      I listened to the audiobook, which is the best thing about this book. Hearing Kate Mulgrew speak is magical. But content didn't seem "deep" enough, despite some pretty huge life changes. Then, it just ended. Not bad, not great...but definitely a pleasure to hear Mulgrew's own voice tell her tale....
      Not enough of a story.
      <strong>Boring !</strong><br /><br />I can not believe that I read the whole thing. It moves so slow. I kept thinking that it would be better as I read along but it just got worse. I have read several books with the same story. Don't bother wasting your time.
      4th book in the Mistress of the Art of Death series. Upsetting ending to the series with too many unanswered questions because of the death of the author. Hoping her daughter continues Adelia's story.
      Pretty spare storywise. I understand that this is meant to be the start of the series but you have to compel me to want to read more. As it stands, I wasn't particularly interested in any of the characters and the supposed mean girl was defeated way too easily.
      Did not finish this one. The story was choppy and I disliked the characters.
      The concept was intriguing but the story felt too simplistic, as if the author ran out of ideas after the initial good one. The characters were flat and cliched.
      I wanted to like this book, but it reminded me of those condescending books written for children that talk about bullying or drugs. It had some good information, but it was too simplistic, and the situations they described were too neat, and too perfect.
      Liked the text, illustrations not my favorite.
      I find it difficult to understand why people like these books. The story here depends on the feasibility of a technology which very few of us are expert enough to have an opinion on. A major part of the plot makes no sense, and the relationship between Scarpetta and Benton in the course of the da...
      What?
      Ehh... no.
      A slow and vanilla cash in on the Travelling Pants books. It took me until about about halfway through to feel involved with the characters and even then I wasn't all that interested in the outcome of their stories.
      DNF. Just not for me.
      Mama read this to me today. I loved all of the elements on the endpapers best, but it's a really good book overall.
      It took me weeks to get through this. I wasn't compelled to read yet I still wanted to know what happened. Ultimately though, I found the writing style a bit pretentious and although the characters did ring true, I didn't really like them much.
      1.5 <br /><br />Felt like I was reading fan fiction or a Wattpad story. Not my style, sorry.
      Way too complex for me!
      I'm always wary when an older comedian/comedy writer/comedy actor releases a book about aging. Everyone knows what the jokes will be about, and the reader gets exactly what they expect. Nevertheless, I love to listen to celebrity memoirs in my car during my commute. The first half of this book wa...
      A cute coffe table book. I like what the photographer stands for. I would've preferred if it had bios of the dogs, especially the adoptable ones. Maybe the owners too, their family story. There was a dog named Sadie, which shouldn't have surprised me but it did &amp; that ruined my enjoyment of t...
      There's a lot of artistic young woman passion here, which I can completely appreciate. I desperately wanted to love this book in its entirety; sad to say I lost interest more than halfway through it.
      While I did really enjoy the concept of the book, I agree with other reviewers in that the art really let it down. It was hard to work out what was going on at times and a lot of the male characters were indistinguishable from each other. I think it would have been of great benefit to use colour rather than black and white. The main 'plot twist' is easily guessable from the start of the story. Overall I wasn't a big fan.

      This is a retelling of the Pygmalion story or if you are not familiar with that, “My Fair Lady”. It follows so closely to that story line that I almost started to sing “The rain In Spain, stays mainly in the plain”.

      This is a very simply written book describing Nelson Mandela's life after he was being released from prison. Since then the author had been his private secretary, next to him and was able to observe him and the South African politics closely. She describes how South Africa changed during her service. Also, Nelson Mandela’s personal side to his relationships and his behavior in times of crises are told through one of the closest eyes next to him. Additionally, the author later gives us a view of how Nelson Mandela’s family relationships were. While him addressing great humanitarian problems, racism, discrimination and so on, in South Africa and around the world, on his close proximity, there were family issues. In general, it is a simple to read book and gives some perspective about Nelson Mandela’s daily life and how he was able to manage his time. His fund raising trips, international visits to many world leaders and so on are described. However, in my personal opinion, Nelson Mandela’s values and his world view is kind of lacking in this book. I was hoping to learn more of his ideology. I think I’ll get that from Long Walk to Freedom
      The beginning was good. Middle was...mediocre. Found the horror idea lame. Skimmed to the end. Not worth the time.
      Boring.
      This is only delicious if you really enjoy the taste of cliches.
      "You can't have a romantic relationship if you can't touch your partner" is basically what Juliette is teaching young readers in this book. Great job.
      I'm not sure I even know where to start with this book. One of the biggest complaints I’ve read about this book are the romantic interests. Main character shows interest in two people. Honestly, this doesn't bother me much most of the time in books; it’s teenagers. High Schoolers tend to ‘crush’...

      Boring.
      When I found this book my first thought was “Tattoos and threesomes, what can go wrong” Oh so much. This was one of the most boring read I have ever forced myself through, and I only did that because it was too late to get my money back. It’s impossible to get a read of the characters because they are all over the place. The FMC is downright unlikable. The physical descriptions are contradictive. The language is repetitive. And the constant “like a teenager” makes me think the author has a screwed idea of what teenagers are like. A little over halfway through the book and I had to stop. It’s horrible. It’s not sexy. I didn’t even bother with the two following books because I expect them to be as bad.
      very disappointing, I was sorry not to be able to read it. His essay in NY Times was so much better.
      Ok
      DNF. Narration was crap..
      A horrid little book. I refuse to finish.
      I hated it.
      This isn't a bad book nor is it poorly written. It was cute. But nothing in me believes that this is a read for Young Adults or Adults reading Young Adult; it is more for middle schoolers.
      I am torn between not liking this book and thinking it was ok. My main problem with this was not the involvement of God, but the writing. I am a huge fan of writing styles, and this did not have any to begin with. If an author goes with a first person narration, s/he needs to make sure that the voice is unique. But the narrator in this had the same voice as the narrator from 2 States, which is the only other book of the author I've read. Overall verdict: meh.
      I don't think I can do this one. It might be too slow for me.
      There's no point to this! This could easily have been a blog post, not an ebook...
      Just like with book 2 of this series I couldn't finish this book. I usually love librarian romances. I have to admit I felt this book had more sex than story line.

      Disappointingly shallow treatment of the subject.
      <strong>What</strong><br /><br />Sorry, I didn't like this story at all. The storyline was bad and I didn't like the characters. The heroine cried through the entire story and the hero's wife was crazy.
      This book should be subtitled Sarah Harding saves the motherf***ing day
      To me, this series with all of the novellas is dragging on too long. I don't mind getting a peek inside their HEA during a novel with a new H/h...but to keep having novellas with the same characters is too much.
      <strong>Boring</strong><br /><br />I could not read half way through it . but I want dairy of a angry Alex 10 please .
      It was okay, certainly not fantastic.
      This book has no merit at all. Why it us selected for any purpose by anyone us beyond me.
      Fuck this book. No one read it. The first story was annoying, the second story was sexist and offensive and the third story's protagonist was so unlikable that I was rooting for her to be unhappy. Seriously, don't read this piece of trash.

      This was possibly the strangest book I have ever read. There were a few great quotes but mostly, this one fell flat for me.
      I’m not overly excited about this one. My university lecturer wants us to take notes when we read this, and come to a conclusion whether or not we think the author was a racist. I can’t say I’m overly looking forward to the experience. But, you never know, I may think he wasn’t and really like th...
      I want my money back.
      Starts with so much potential, but about 2/3rds of the way through it becomes repetitive and characters start behaving in inconsistent ways, or just ignoring or not using the great powers they were said to have earlier.<br /><br />It reads like a standard YA novel with some "grown up" bits tossed in. And rep...
      <strong>Disappointed</strong><br /><br />I love Mary Higgins Clark. But this book was such a major disappointment. I like the characters Willy and Alvirah in the other books they are in. But this book is so unbelievable. Very unrealistic and annoying for me.
      Eh. Mason was unhappy the whole time till the last chapter. I wasn't feeling it as much as the other books.

      Too brutal
      Bad book.
      I did not enjoy this book.
      It went on too long for me.
      Disappointingly appropriative at best. Seemed to be attempting to critique orientalism and racism in fantasy, but often ended up perpetuating. Pratchett occasionally fails in this manner in other books, but none (that I have so far read) so wholly.
      While I like the idea of taking about prayer and spiritual warfare, this book wasn't practical enough for me. It was broken down into 10 part of your life the enemy likes to attack. It just got a little monotonous.
      the book was alright.
      I was very disappointed in this book. It did not live up to the promise that was raised by "the poor mouth" (definitely a 5 star book). This book is highly experimental (other reviewers have likened it to Ulysses - or, worse still, Finnegan's Wake - and their ilk). Clearly the writer is clever, but in this case clever does not translate into funny or enjoyable. I think the book has many bizarre but unfortunately not very funny and rather tedious passages. For me the cleverness does not make up for what I in the end think is a waste of time.
      Did not enjoy this book.
      Hated it.
      i could not get into the story.

      This is basically a romance between an older man and a younger woman, the norm for this time period.
      These books are increasingly poorly written, descending into gratuitous violence and lack of plot. I kind of enjoyed the first novel, but after the escape from the maze it lost direction, credibility, and, frankly, interest.
      So disappointing compared to #1!

      Beautiful cookbook. A huge variety of recipes with illustrated instructions. Far too advanced for my skill or interest level. A great gift for a talented and/or ambitious cook.
      Song of Ice and Fire v5.2 - I'm still loving the series, and now begins the long wait for publication of the next book. If you've read the previous books, you know if you want to carry on. If not, this is not the place to start.
      <strong>...</strong><br /><br />Not really sure what to say.. I did not like this book at all, but wasn't the worst. The editing was horrible.
     Absolutely horrible.
      The story of a young boy with autism, and his experiences and views of the world, this book is for children but does include strong themes and language, which young readers and their guardians should be aware of. Many have loved this novel, and it has even made it to stage. Unfortunately, I found this book to be offensive and insensitive particularly in relation to people who struggle with both physical and mental disabilities. For this reason, I felt upset and uncomfortable reading it, and must give my first negative review.
      The short stories never really grab you.
      Horrible!
      Bad book
      Well, I guess that I am crazy because this book of stories didn’t bowl me over as I expected and as it did most everyone else. It is not the darkness of them. I enjoy a gothic twist. A Good Man Is Hard To Find, the first story, lured me in a bit but the stories went down from there. Neither the c...
      It is an interesting little book about relationships. I might be too young to understand some of them but it is portraying common situations and talks that we experience. Mostly how we avoid answering questions and how we destroy ourself by creating problems.

      Terrible. Just inconceivably bad. And I love Jennifer Egan. Don't get me wrong. The last 20 pages of this book were lovely, though.
      I remember reading this book right before the movie came out. It started off great but the author did very little world building and character progression. such a boring and disturbing read.
      Like other reviews have said, By Light Alone is a great premise that's ruined by a poorly told story. Although “story” is a bit misleading since there's effectively two or three separate story threads here that are then forced together in order to justify a novel. <br /><br />By Light Alone is set in a world...
      I think Malcolm is running out of big ideas. This is basically a collection of magazine articles about how different people became successful. A lot of them are pretty interesting, but when he tries to stretch small observations into big points about the world, it often strains credulity.

      It had a good premise, but fell short. I didn't care for the ending at all!
      somewhat lame.

      Boring beginning. Boring middle. Pretty good ending.
      Couldn't even finish it. I think the first chapter or so would have been enough to explain who he was, what happened to him after the assassination. Just not interesting enough to finish and I love historical fiction/non-fiction.
      ***ARC Provided by the author and NetGalley***<br /><br />I wanted to like this. The cover and storyline in the blurb appealed to me.

      I agree with other reviewers that this book just does not measure up to her previous titles. Not that a Tori Spelling book is necessarily a literary masterpiece, but the others had a theme and she spoke in a more genuine, open, honest way. This book felt like you were in an uncomfortable room with Spelling and her mother; both of them with frozen faces, afraid to say anything bad about the other lest the press have a field day. The only "real" subject that she seems to cover is the invasion of reality TV into their lives and for as much as she claims to love it (and love the people working on the show) it has diminished her earning capacity and given the public expectations for her that she cannot shake. For better or worse, it will be a long time before anyone can separate Tori Spelling from "reality TV show figure" and she seems both grateful and bitter about that, since she'd prefer to be acting again. She also seems to speak in a similarly lock-jawed fashion about the difficulties in her marriage. It seems screamingly obvious that they have some major issues and yet they don't want to deal with them because either the TV cameras are watching or - even worse - the cameras are NOT watching. She recounts some instances where a genuine, organic moment had to be re-created for the cameras or given more drama. It just seems like everyone involved is setting themselves up to fail - the marriage has problems, the kids are a handful, neither Tori nor Dean can find a steady, meaningful income, Mama Spelling doesn't want to pitch in financially and resents being 'played' for TV ratings... I wish them best of luck, but in the end it makes for a boring book.
      The final book in the series is alternately narrated by Grace, Greer and Gretchen, the triplet descendants of the mythical gorgons.<br />I would have liked more references to the ancient Greek myths. I also believe it might have worked better as a satire.
      Light and humorous. This book shows the intense bond between triplet women in their 30's.
      I definitely preferred Schlink's book "Der Vorleser."
      It's a very interesting premise. The crimes are definitely brutal and awful. However, the writing reminds me of a high school student turning in an essay with a minimum word count. A lot could have been edited out.
      It sucked.
      read for children's literature class
      <strong>A STRANGE AND GRUESOME STORY</strong><br /><br />There is little merit to this tale. It is inconclusive and not worth spending time on. It has no redeeming qualities. I do not recommend it.

      Terrible. Couldn't finish it.

      Hated. Reminded me of a bad Disney movie.
      I was super excited about this book. Unfortunately I think it made my expectations too high. Guinevere wanted to be a very strong character but she seems very weak. I would think that with all the stories there are of her she would be a lot more confident.
      coudnt finish it...i dont understand why everyone loves this book so much.
      It was ok. These stories all seem to be really short and so I feel like we miss out on a lot of what could happen. I don't know.. It was good.. I just wish we could get more story!
      <strong>Waste of time and money</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />I'm not going to give this book a single star. Complete waste of time. Nothing in here useful and the book is only a 2 minute read at most. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      I'm not a giant Tori Spelling fan, but I don't dislike her either and a friend recommended her books as perfect, light material for me to read while recuperating from surgery and this book totally delivers.

      I liked the first book in the series, but this one was not such a good story. I didn't feel like the situation was believable. There were also many grammatical/typing mistakes in the beginning of the book which always distracts me. It needed better editing.
      this story didn't appeal to me. the topic and premise were fine, but the writing didn't work for me.
      <strong>Ok book</strong><br /><br />That was the shortest book I believe I have ever read. I was sitting down thinking this was going to be a long book, I had the whole thing done in less than an hour. Really glad I didn't buy this book!
      This is one of two books I took with me for airplane reading, wanting a book I did not need to bring home. I simply did not care after 100 pages and switched to the other book.
      This book is very geared towards mothers, which thankfully I'm not.
      <strong>Ridiculous</strong><br /><br />I can't believe this is the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird. There's no story here at all. Really juvenile.
      How many times to people have to say that communication is key? Not annoyed, just bored.
      <strong>Important subject matter but a frustrating read</strong><br /><br />I am glad the author wrote this book because we need to remember the atrocities that happened in Germany, but the story was frustrating to read. The first half was quite long and detailed, and the last few chapters left out the details I'd been waiti...
      Terrible, unhelpful, poor writing, awful format, scrapped-together piece of a book. If you want some real advice and something helpful, don't waste your time with this.
      a very long history
      Ugh! A literary masterpiece????? I think not!!!
      Meh
      Oh the barking... this one gets tiresome...
      Full disclosure: Got 150 pages into it and was bored to tears. What am I missing!?
      I give up. This book is so slow and I can't relate to the opera stuff at all.
      Some decent writing appeared unexpectedly at points. Still pretty basic tho
      Could hardly finish this. Only one of the series I read. Too many characters. So not interesting.
      Note to the author: one does not simply mix the Italian mafia, animal shape-shifting humans, star-crossed lovers and a pubescent dialogue into a book. The result is horrendous.
      Awesome
      Blech...and yet, I can't help myself....onto the next book!
      Zero stars people - zero!!! But I bought the next book! Figure that one out lololol
      Contrived rather unconvincingly. Motivations of the characters aren't always reasonable.
      Too many names to keep track of and the romance between the two main characters was hard to believe.
      <strong>Reads Like a Dry History Book</strong><br /><br />The author knows his stuff, but instead of an entertaining fantasy novel of the English battling to control the magical land of Ireland in the 14th century you get something very slow, terribly wordy and lacking any likable characters.

      saddest book ever!
      Horrible.
      This is a short book compared to the books I usually read- around 220 pages long. I was expecting it to get into the story quite quickly for that reason but found it was taking me ages to read because around halfway through nothing had really happened yet. I wanted to read this after hearing about how 'scary' everyone found the film in the cinema but there wasn't really anything to be scared of. The only real good part for me was the plot line in the last ten pages, which was obvious anyway from what I'd previously read.
      <em>On A Dark Wing</em> is a mostly forgettable drudge through a YA adaption of <em>Meet Joe Black</em>, with even less plot, less believable circumstances and less interesting characters. Return the several hours wasted on this book, please.
      Waste of time.
      This book was an interesting portrayal of the author's realization that although she planned to be a lawyer, she quickly realized she wanted to be less intense, more stay at home mum type. It could lead to some interesting conversations, but the book itself wasn't written that well.
      Meh ...
      If it hadn’t been for all the 5 star reviews on here and on Amazon, I think I would have given up on this one. The first three quarters of the book are so slow and the characters are so repugnant (and confusingly similar) that even a half decent ending doesn’t excuse the tedious journey it takes...
      2.5. It was ok. Interesting to see how the author did MC for YA.
      Couldn't finish it. Very slow and boring.
      I'm guessing at the date; may have been in the 1970's. Very, very depressing. Excellent writing but I would never read another book by Malamud.
      Despite moments of beautiful writing, I did not enjoy the experience of reading this book.
      I couldn't finish it, I thought it was boring, it felt long even though technically it's not :(
       Stopped at 51%. Not really keeping my interest at this point. Though, they are a very sweet couple and it's very, very low angst. Maybe that's the problem...no conflict of any type yet. I'll give it try later.
      For a story about a wedding, there were only about 5 chapters about the wedding &amp; wedding prep out of 42 chapters.
      Zero.
      Not interesting at all.
      <strong>The trilogy was interesting and pretty well written, BUT</strong><br /><br />It should have all been in one book. I will not be buying any further books by Sierra Rose because I believe this marketing ploy is cheating and unethical
      Disappointing book. Had so much potential, but it was just a chore to read. Great concept, great setting, so many great ideas. But just really dull and laboured. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't.
     Was disappointed in this book.
      Witches really are a detestable breed. They disguise themselves as lovely ladies, when secretly they want to squish and squelch all the wretched children they despise. Luckily one boy and his grandmother know how to recognize these vile creatures, but can they get rid of them for good?
      I'm stopping this book. Too depressing. I hate downward spirals where the characters do bad things for no good reason &amp; just keep going down.
      <strong>Bad</strong><br /><br />Who ever thought of a silver pickaxe it goes like would to stone stone to iron iron to gold and gold to diamond.
      oh...
      Similar to Modesitt's Imager's portfolio, he has simply re-written the first three books a few thousand years in the past. The protagonist is identical to that of every other one of his novels. The first three books were enjoyable, stop here and come back and read the remaining books once the fir...
      I bought this on the recommendation of a colleague when away with work but only read it after watching the film. After watching the film I was expecting it to follow one character/ a group of people. When it didn't I was initially intrigued as I thought it seemed a good idea, but I don't think it...
      This was a little disappointing, the other books were so full of so much... Well it at least ended as expected. <br />
      I think I'm the only one in the world who hated this book. It annoyed the crap out of me. It lays out a canned formula to live. Turn-off for me.
      I can honestly say that I don't know WTF I just read.
      What a load of bollocks!<br /><br /><br />Full review to come. <br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>EXTRAS:</strong><br /><br />Since I suffered whilst reading this travesty of a book, it’s only fair I make you suffer through another rendition of Carly Rae Jepson’s song. I call it <strong>‘Call me Crazy’</strong>. I can’t take all the credit for the lyrics :)<br /><br />[spoilers removed]<br /><br />Seriously,...
      DNF at 50%<br /><br />I loved Gena's zombie series and when I saw her and heard her talk about this one, I was instantly interested. Sadly, it just didn't work out. <br /><br />I liked Ten. She's resilient and snarky and refuses to let anyone force her into this important decision. I also liked most of the characters I...
      What the hell was the hype all about? This book was complete shit. And the ending was super predictable.
      Very boring book I tried reading the most I could but got very bored.
      This book was highly disappointing. I watch and love the show (and I'm looking forward to the movie) so I thought the book would be a sure bet. Turns out, the writers for the show are so much more smart, clever, and interesting that Bushnell could ever be. The Sex and the City book was just full...
      A do not read
      This was ridiculous. It was incredibly self-indulgent and trite. It's incredible that someone read this collection of articles and said, "Hey! Let's turn this into a wildly funny, intelligent, and timely series that will win Emmys and Jill's Heart!" Avoid the book, rent the series.
      I couldn't even finish this book.
      this book is sucking my butt. i'm halfway thru and praying it gets better -FAST.<br />should have listened to Jim-"what do yo wanna read that crap for?"
      This book just wasn't for me. It was a DNF book. Maybe another time, but for now it is a one star.
      My second DNF for the year… after about 150 pages I couldn't continue with this one.<br />Started off quite good, but just lost my interest as it went along….. <br />Maybe it's just me? It got quite good reviews, so I'm disappointed that I didn't like it.<br />Found the characters not at all believable - didn't re...
      Just a weird book with no substantiation and very little logic, if you look at the review chart its mostly #1's out of 5 - I read it however I don't understand a bit of what the author was trying to convey, prove or describe. Poor writing structure, sentence, paragraph and overall format / intro...
      awful.
      Not my cup of tea!
      Lord, what an awful book. Awash in mediocrity from first page to last. It has mediocre characters (the same which were so captivating in "Silence of the Lambs"), mediocre dialogue, mediocre scenery, virtually no suspense (but a plethora of pointlessly putrid acts), and a meandering narrative that...
      This book sucks so bad. It's boring, and I could care less about the characters. It is rare that I don't finish a book, but I just couldn't get through this one.
      CREEPY!
      an utter embarrassment. i hope harris enjoyed his trip to the bank. the only reason i own it is because i also own first editions of <em>silence of the lambs</em> and <em>red dragon</em>. to hell with being a completist, i will not be adding <em>hannibal rising</em> to my collection.
      Ugh - what a terrible book. I recently joined a book group that reads books devoted to parenting issues. The leader of the group thought that this book would be a great place to start because it is short and it is supposed to be funny. Well, she at least got the short part right. Other than that,...
      I thought that this book was terrible. At times it was funny, but overall, I found no point in it.
      I would have given this book a higher rating, however in my opinion this book fell apart when Sarah's voice disappears and we are left with pages and pages of Julia's self centered whine.
      My favorite part was when it was over.
      complete and utter poo. the reason she's so damn stupid is that she's obviously undernourished. Get that woman a cheeseburger- STAT!
      I hated this book. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated it. I'm sad no stars is not actually a rating. This is my least favorite book ever. And I've done a lot of reading. <br /><br />The problem is that it is written by some guy who apparently thinks he is God's gift to philosophy. And if you don't agree with...
      Absolute rot. Even though I agree with the heavy-handed theme I couldn't finish it.
      No. Just no. Absolutely not. I could NOT continue this book. The only minute thing I found interesting was that the car accident managed to knock the dog's balls off somehow. Other than that, I couldn't stand any more. No no no no no. Hell fucking shit no.
      This is a very simplistic and predictable book playing on parents fears and stereotypes. There are so many good thrillers out there, don't waste your time on this one. I would have discarded it after 20 pages if I wasn't reading it for a bookclub. Skim read the rest with no missing of the story -...
      <br />This book is not for me. I promised I'd read it, I was hopeful it would be a guilty pleasure, but there was nothing that appealed to me. NOTHING except returning it to the library.
      Just garbage. Poorly written and concepts are self-important drivel that don't actually say anything. Here's a prime example sentence:<br />"In Scientology, the word 'postulate' means to cause a thinkingness or consideration."<br /><br />THINKINGNESS?! You have a good word right there to use! I know you know it be...
      I don't really have much to say about this book.
      <strong>Full disclosure:</strong> I read to page 200, skimmed to from there to page 327, then read till the end. If you dislike it when reviewers don't finish books before embarking on a review, then I'm about to really upset you.<br /><br /><em>In a World Just Right</em> had a really cool premise: a teen who can create worlds with h...
      This book was awful. I'm so angry that I spent 8 hours or so listening to this crap. I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19501.Eat__Pray__Love" title="Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert"> <img src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1294023455s/19501.jpg" alt="Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /></a>, and even though, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738.Committed_A_Skeptic_Makes_Peace_with_Marriage" title="Committed A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage by Elizabeth Gilbert"> <img src="http://photo.goodreads.com/books/1255618440s/6728738.jpg" alt="Committed A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage by Elizabeth Gilbert" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /></a> was not getting very good reviews, I figured that I would check it out on audio - BAD MOVE!!!<br /><br />First, the reader, hoping to learn about the next phase of Gilbert's life instea...
      It is so badly written I couldn't finish it
      I have never been too sure how anyone takes this guy seriously.
      god, sean hannity is an idiot asshole.
      Okay, seriously....fuck this book.
      Holy shit this was bad.
      I had to read this for book club and I did not like it. Bad theology wrapped up in a sappy soap opera type book. <br /><br />I don't disagree with the message that God loves us and wants a relationship with us, but this book is so full of pot-holes and misinterpretations that renders useless:<br /><br />The Jesus charac...
      Ohhhhhh, The Progam. Where do I begin?<br /><br />I guess I'll start with Sloane, who is the most dull and lifeless narrator I've ever had to experience a story through. I felt as if she liked to tell rather than show, and I was emotionally detached throughout this entire story. That could make me cold-heart...
      Meh.
      You could tell this shit was written by a thirteen year old.
      This book is easily among the worst I've ever read. The story entirely lacked plausibility (ironically, the 'abomination' is perhaps the most believable aspect of it). Martha's interaction with her parents was badly written, and, even when disregarding that, there is still the gaping plotholes an...
      <br />I can't do it. <strong><em>This</em> is truly awful.</strong> I'm going to cut my losses short and throw in the towel before it causes irreparable damage. <br /><br />I did get to page 20 - that has to be an accomplishment in itself, right? I'm surprised I even lasted that long. My head hurts like hell though!! Excuse me, while I go...
      The author of this book is certainly one of the five or ten biggest nutjobs in the history of the world. Complete raving lunatic. No one should ever listen to a thing he says. If you agree with him, you're some kind of Nazi scumbag.
      Fuck! I hate this. I give up. I can't anymore. The last page I actually read was 217, so I didn't officially "finish" this book, but it will go into my finished pile. I need all the help I can get. My goal was 50 books this year, and Im 8 books behind. I will count this book as read no matter wha...
      I had to read this just to see... and I was right. Crap. I can't believe people think like this.
      The horror! The horror!
      Horrible. I don't know why I bothered.
      Not the worst book ever written, but pretty fucking close.<br /><br />I must begin by saying that since Hannity is below a purely academic discussion, resorting to personal insults won't trouble my conscience at all. And since I'd rather flog myself than read more conservative trash, I'm gonna try to get as...
      I've come to the conclusion that Holly Black just isn't for me. Read two of her books and both sucked. You'd better bet that I'm not touching that faerie series of hers.
      No...no no no no. Argh! the writing. Why? Why be such a pain on the reader's brain? If you want to punish me so much for picking up this book, fine, I give up.
      meh.<br /><br />I'm not going to puree spinach in hide it in brownies. No way.<br />
      I feel like I have been punked.
      Do you want me to be honest? <br /><br />This is one of the worst books I've ever read. <br /><br />Every time I see the raving reviews it's gotten, <strong>I want to stab myself. </strong>This book is poorly written, poorly executed, and poorly plotted. It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible. And I have absolutely no respect for Jenni...
      I don't even know how to describe my deception with this book. <br />The main character, Gwen is really annoying, dumb and selfish. <br />In the story, Gwen and her mother, are always moving to different places, everytime her mother thinks they are in danger. There are monsters trying to get them. <br />So, one da...
      And this is where I gave up on this series. I just couldn't connect with the characters.
      One of the worst books I have ever read. Now I can honestly say Scientology is one of the most assinine concepts ever.
      What an embarrassment. I can't believe he is actually the standard bearer for the Dems. And the sad thing is his book reveals it. If you are undecided, read this book carefully - it will persuade you to RUN AWAY from this incompetent, yet corrupt, Chicago machine politician who believed his own p...

      Hated this book
      He's serious! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
      I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this book much less read it. I would not recommend this book or this author to anyone. Weak story, no character development, and dumb ending... nuf said!
      1.5 stars. This book was shit.
      crap
      Life is too short to read bad books. I got to page 44.
      Its not very often I don't finish a fictional book, but this one I couldn't stand. It a was boring &amp; predictable book full of Christian clichés and stereotypes. I would file this under Christian twaddle. I couldn't finish it.<br /><br />
      Sigh. Didn't love this one, sadly. With its dull characters and less than stellar writing, Midnight Thief ended up falling flat for me. <br /><br />Full review to come.
      <strong>DNF</strong><br /><br /><strong> <em>THIS BOOK WAS HORRENDOUS!</em> </strong><br /><br />Review to come.....
      I hated this book. There is some really nasty stuff going on that had no point in my opinion.
      boo. I hate this book
      DNF'd at 75%. <br /><br />Sadly, this just isn't holding my interest. This had a really cool concept, but the plot does nothing for me.
      Okay, at page 156 this crossed over from boring to painful to read. <br /><br />And it's not that I don't understand what the author is trying to do here. Low self-esteem country girl, bully misogynistic husband, starting a new life and all that. It's probably mostly realistic. I've met enough couples like t...
      Cassandra Clare, in the name of the Lord on high, stop writing. Just... stop writing things. At least, things related to The Mortal Instruments. Please, stop beating this dead horse before I haul in some Dying with Dignity organization to sue your ass. <br /><br />IT. IS. TIME. TO. MOVE. ON.
      A disappointment. It had so much potential too.. but then I read on another review that the author is a romance book writer, and then it all made sense: The cookie cutter characters, the silly plot, and the oh so obvious murderer. <br /><br />The only positive is that it does make me want to read the Venerab...
      Poorly written and pseudoscience.
      this book is total garbage. The church I was going to promoted it and wanted the whole church to do the 40 days of purpose in 2004. I started to do the reading but thought this is like torture to read this crap every day for 40 days. I hated it and after reading how Rick Warren sang Jimi Hendrix'...
      Meh... bad character development and didn't really get any chemistry. <br />
      umm...no
      Oh this book was baaaaad.
      Boring.... nothing of note happened. Perhaps it's meant for a younger crowd.
      I didn't like it because it was fiction parading as non-fiction, from the story to the author. William Ayers wrote this book, not Obama. And it's filled from the first page to the last with evasions, omissions, obfuscations, skirtings of the truth, and outright lies.
      What a waste of good paper and ink. This is my first Philippa book and will be my last. Prior to this book I had read every book that Sharon Kay Penman wrote. To say the least I was shocked at the difference in writing style and ability between these two authors. Where Sharon's writing flows and...
      Meh.
      I can't accurately describe how much I disliked this book, so I won't. At least, not for now. Later, when I've <strong>cooled down a little</strong>, I might give it a try. <br />Maybe.<br />Perhaps.<br />Oh, lord, it's happening again. I'm getting the rages. Must pour bucket of water above head.
      The biggest problem I have with this book is <em>absolutely NOTHING happens!</em>
      I got to page 600 and decided to call it quits. I kept nodding off falling asleep and the book did not keep my attention. It started out well enough, but gets bogged down on to much garbage. Maybe this works with a female audience, but not with me.
      Puerile platitudes posing as wisdom.
      DNF. <br /><br />This was equal parts boring and horrible. Mead essentially relies of the readers' knowledge and perception of Asian culture because there is absolutely no world building to be found. I was excited initially for this because it <em>seemed</em> like Mead was branching out. Unfortunately, this turned ou...
      Pure unadulterated crap. Cliche masquerading (unsuccessfully) as wisdom.
      DNF somewhere around page 180<br /><br />The Maze Runner was good, not anything great or spectacular, the Scorch Trials was okay, and then since I didn't care to finish the Death Cure, you can imagine my distaste for it.<br /><br />Frankly speaking, the characters were some weakly portrayed guys and girls. I didn't get...

      I did not enjoy this book at all. It was a struggle to finish it. Especially at the beginning, there is far too much gratuitous sex and violence and really foul language. Didn't help that I was listening to this via audible. I almost returned it- it was that bad. It got marginally better. At leas...
      If I could give this no stars, I would. This is possibly one of my least favorite books in the world, one that I would happily take off of shelves and stow in dark corners where no one would ever have to read it again.<br /><br />I think that To Kill A Mockingbird has such a prominent place in (American) cul...
      Meh.
      I hate this book. I will probably end up reading the rest of them, because if I don't, people that love this thing will think they can convert me if I just keep reading. (<strong>ETA (Jan. 2013):</strong> Never even remotely bothered to finish the series.)<br /><br />In short: the writing mechanics are <em>atrocious.</em> The dialogu...
      Really disjointed storytelling and uninspiring dialogue. I am not sure I understand the title's relation to the plot either, or the significance of the main character's choice to become a roofer (which seemed to be highlighted often) except to make her ability to push over large appliances more c...
      No. Just...no.
      So bitterly disappointed with this. To be led on this journey with Tris and Four and be made to care so deeply about them, to then be handed that ending? I'm getting my money back!
      Annoying.
      After so much buzz I was looking forward to reading this one, but was sadly disappointed. The characters were either flat or just plain boring.
      Absolute garbage. Easily the worst book I’ve read in 2008, and certainly a contender for Worst Book I’ve Ever Read. This crap won the prestigious Whitbread Book of the Year honors, and while I have absolutely no idea what that entails, I firmly support both the eradication of this farcical award...

      WHY GOD, WHY?<br />This kind of crap is suitable only for the walls of a pediatrician’s office. Even then, as you wait for the doctor, you think, "maybe I should take my child somewhere else."<br />
      All I can do is shake my head in disgust. How can a human being be so proud of being so stupid?
      I didn't like this book and hated the main character. I've never understood what all the fuss is about and how anyone would want to emulate him in real life. As you know, this book is at the root at some real life person's desires to kill celebrity figures. I still don't get why.
      I tried picking this up many times but it's too boring for me.
      Oh, geez. Bad book is bad.
      Laughably terrible
      why oh why do I read this crap. usually I am coming off of some heavy, awful WW2 book, when I grab some fluff for a break, and alas, Spark offs more people. I think he's a serial murderer. He seems to get off on it.
      DNF at 30%. I started this because The Jewel had an evil cliffhanger and I really wanted to know what happened to the characters.

      My advice- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS, GO PICK SOMETHING ELSE.......
      Eesh, this was dull. I can't even try and appreciate it taking historical context into account. These little women are so blah. And they speak like they're reciting Hallmark cards half the time.
      quite disappointed. Several reviews mentioned that it was worth it to stick with it to the end, so I did. But, I felt pretty cheated. 3/4 of the book is made up of two intellectual snobs telling us that only they are superior and truly understand the world...the rest are a bunch of selfish buffoo...

      This book was okay. Nothing fantastic, but not terrible. When I was recapping the story to my husband, he said "sounds like a Lifetime movie" and then I realized that yeah, it did.

      Huge disappointment. :(
      Snore.
      Horrible.
      lame. <br /><br />the book is completely condescending. at one point i recall the author stating something to the effect of: "if you don't understand anything in this book, reread it until you understand it." it's also got a glossary in the back which is strange. further, there were illustrations to the "bel...
      Nope.<br /><br />The only good thing I can take away from this novel is knowing I have never, and will never be able to identify with Holden Caulfield.
      keep it by your toilet so when you run out of t.p. you can wipe your bottom with these pages.
      Ehhh...got a bit better towards the end, but I really struggled with, I'd say, the first 80% of this book. The main character wasn't very likable at times, nor were most of the secondary characters.<br /><br />The idea of the book was a great one, it's just the execution didn't quite work for me.
      Um. Wow. This book was...bad.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TIVp2h.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="228" class="gr-hostedUserImg" /><br /><br />I'm legitimately distraught that this novel came from the mind of someone who I once thought of as a goddess, who I once believed was on par with Marissa Meyer, Leigh Bardugo, even Marie Lu.

      Hannibal was a big disappointment, especially the ending.<br /><br />I think Hannibal Lecter works best as a minor character. He's best in the shadows as the mysterious boogey man.

      The reason I'm writing here is because this was one of the most irritating books I've ever read. It's self-indulgent, narcistic and over-rated. Hope it's not your favorite.
      I read this in book club 2-3 years ago. What a waste of time.
      Waste of my time. Thanks for the news flash that a large percentage of women (big and small) hate their bodies.<br /><br />I bumped her from 1 star to 2 because she had a great interview with a 91 year old yoga instructor. That was it.<br /><br /><br />
      1. I intentionally read some real crap. This book is worse than those books. This might be the worst book I have ever read. <br /><br />2. On the cover is a Nazi riding a Unicorn. A motherfucking Nazi is riding a fucking UNICORN!! That is fucking badass. That is the kind of shit that should just write itself...
      unreadable, inaccurate, preposterous. here are some facts for the writer; <br />after the battle of jaxartes, I am pretty sure that the only thing sychtians would give to alexander was his death, not a magical drug.<br />constantinapole was conquered by turks and tatars in 15th century not by arabs in 17th c...
      It doesn't seem fair to give a review of a book I couldn't finish. I made it to about 100 pages and decided this wasn't my type of book. The writing was sloppy and the story uninteresting.
      A classic… bore?<br /><br />Okay. So I get that this was written a long time ago. And the times they have a-changed (thank gawd). But something still doesn’t sit well with me having read Little Women. Technically a classic right? Forgive me if I’m wrong but I was under the impression that classic literature...
      Disappointing! For a book supposedly about climate change, there was too much politicizing and not enough hard science! Too much Al Gore....UGH!
      i thought this was complete poop. there is something to thinking positive, but "things" don't just materialize because you want them to.
      This is a terrible book. The author sees the real problem of father hunger, and tries to fix it with a mammy.
      Total bunk
      glenn beck is a complete idiot. i don't think even he believes this garbage that he writes. i didn't know who he was, or what his political stance was before i started reading it, it just looked like an interesting title. unfortunately, the title lies.
      One sided.
      Pretty much hated it. I suppose it might be interesting in a flip-side-of-Heart-of-Darkness thing, but it should have been called Random Things Fall Apart Randomly. Or maybe Yams Fall Apart. If you love to read about yams and wife beating, then this is the book for you!
      I'm on page 132 and so far my opinion is THIS BOOK SUCKS. And something tells me that it is not going to get any better.
      Basically not sane. One of the worst books ever written.
      Thought this book was far fetched and boring <br />
