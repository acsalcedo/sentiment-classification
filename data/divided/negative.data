      This story was a nice surprise for me! I expected a sci fi mystery type story going through the details of Dr. Brody Springer discovering a new planet that was first predicted by his late wife, Hope. What this story ended up being, for me at least, was...a love story. There was mystery, action, f...
      Light and humorous. This book shows the intense bond between triplet women in their 30's.
      **I received a free e-book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. This does in no way alter my opinions**<br /><br />I’ve been wanting this book for so long, so when I saw it on Netgalley, I was so excited to read it!! I’d heard pretty much only good things before reading, so my expectations were pr...

      I HAVE NOT FINISHED
      The concept was intriguing but the story felt too simplistic, as if the author ran out of ideas after the initial good one. The characters were flat and cliched.
      Really enjoyed this book. As a Year 1 mum that HATES playground politics it was recommended to me by a similar-minded mum! Easy to read and enjoyable.

      Watership Down is my favourite book of all time. I often revisit the world of rabbits. It is incredibly well-written and the use of rabbit-language really brings this too life, not to mention the incredible descriptive work.<br /><br />Worth a read, always.
      This book has no merit at all. Why it us selected for any purpose by anyone us beyond me.
      "Pieces of Prayer: Theological Essays" provides a wide-variety of thought on prayer by Authoress Kia Wakefield. Each chapter give the reader opportunity to "chew on", contemplate, and even digest some of the insight inside. The personal warmth Ms. Wakefield declares brings the reader into the roo...
      The breakfast club from hell. loved it.
      This was possibly the strangest book I have ever read. There were a few great quotes but mostly, this one fell flat for me.
      Soon after the unexpected death of Julie's grandmother, she and her mother are forced to move across town, where Julie starts at a new high school. Trying to put their lives back together isn't easy. And Julie has never felt so isolated. Her mom starts dating some loser, and she doesn't know who...

Elena is the ‘Marrying Mr. Perfect’ bad girl everyone loves to hate. The two of them have no business being togeth...
      I’m not overly excited about this one. My university lecturer wants us to take notes when we read this, and come to a conclusion whether or not we think the author was a racist. I can’t say I’m overly looking forward to the experience. But, you never know, I may think he wasn’t and really like th...
      I want my money back.
      1.5 rounds up to 2 stars.
      I got a beta version of this recently and I loved it ! Im excited to see any changes and have that beautiful cover in my hands !!
      Like other reviews have said, By Light Alone is a great premise that's ruined by a poorly told story. Although “story” is a bit misleading since there's effectively two or three separate story threads here that are then forced together in order to justify a novel. <br /><br />By Light Alone is set in a world...
      Love this book, funny.
      The mountaintop epiphany experienced by Hans Castorp was worth the mind bend that is this great novel.
      read for children's literature class
      Couldn't put it down!
      <strong>A STRANGE AND GRUESOME STORY</strong><br /><br />There is little merit to this tale. It is inconclusive and not worth spending time on. It has no redeeming qualities. I do not recommend it.
      Very good
      After finishing Pushkin, and while waiting for Lermontov, I picked this one up.<br />It was great. Quick, taut, intriguing stories in a cold climate where the light of day is<br />sporadic.
      Well, I guess that I am crazy because this book of stories didn’t bowl me over as I expected and as it did most everyone else. It is not the darkness of them. I enjoy a gothic twist. A Good Man Is Hard To Find, the first story, lured me in a bit but the stories went down from there. Neither the c...
      It is an interesting little book about relationships. I might be too young to understand some of them but it is portraying common situations and talks that we experience. Mostly how we avoid answering questions and how we destroy ourself by creating problems.
      It was a great book except for the ending... I HATE cliffhangers!
      I don't think Skippyjon Jones is my thing...
      Very excited for book 2
      Too much politics. Not enough Simon and Meg.
      K Is For Killer<br />A lady at work recommended this one to me and loaned me the copy to read. It's a neat little mystery. I like a good whodunit and this is definitely a good one. Sue Grafton has created a whole series around the lady detective that is the main character with a catchy alphabet theme....
      Good practical advice.
      The Key To Midnight<br />I don't have much against this book.. only that it's not really my type of book. Espionage just isn't my thing. Although, the base story was very well thought out.<br />I also read at the end of the book that Koontz had written different parts of the novel at different times and you...
