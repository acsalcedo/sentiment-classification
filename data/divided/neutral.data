      <strong>Not so good</strong><br /><br />Hard to believe the best were that bad. And a fire truck to open the gate not good. Bad ending
      Meh. Beach read at best.
      3,5
      Nice. An Agatha quickie!
      I saw part of the PBS Mystery production and wanted to read the book.<br />The story is inspired by actual events and involves Sir Arthur Conon Doyle and George Ernest Thompson Edalji.<br />A series of vicious and cruel mutilations of ponies and horses is blamed on a local vicar's son named George.<br />When Arthu...
      Gwen Dylan isn't what one would normally think of when zombies come to mind. She holds down a job, sure, it's as a gravedigger but how else is she supposed to get access to brains? The brains taste awful but eating them is a small price to pay once a month to hold onto who she is and to keep her...
      This story has it all: time travel, sexy Scottish Lairds and castles, evil Sorcerers, magic treasure, an Elfin Queen, archeological digs, and of course a damsel in distress. There was so much packed into this story that it was a bit difficult to keep all the storylines straight. There is a backst...
      The book is written in a very interesting style, that I found easy and quick to read. I thought the style was good for a short book, but for a longer novel or rereads it may get annoying.
      Two novellas about a Louisiana town that have the same characters and their romances. Each story is the same old fashion pattern of hurt girl meets boy that has issues and they find love. The characters are likable.
      Strange tale of mental illness and relationships.
      It's just okay. Long on the wit, short on the economics.
      Some really good ideas and thoughts, but way too much name checking (of himself) and other self-referential tricks ...<br />
      Very wordy.
      I enjoyed this book. I will recommend this book to everyone.
      Interesting topic, 200 pages too long.
      Enjoyed this from Con's POV, a little drawn out, but worth the read. The 'family' are wonderful characters, loved the boys.
      I can't help it. I love these things. So predictable, but still so very much fun. The sex scenes are a little long for me and I still love 'em
      Talks about the culture of violence in America and what it means to some people, why they stick with it, and how to undermine it. Focuses mainly on how to give kids, who have been soaking in violence like teabags all their lives in the inner cities, a shot at seeing the world differently. You sho...
      Another timely topic, concussions. Told from two perspectives. Well written.
      <br />This biography of the "sexologists" Masters and Johnson that lead to the hit tv series of the same name. It was interesting to learn more about their groundbreaking research and life in St. Louis. Equally interesting is their personal lives...before they became "Masters and Johnson" and eventuall...
      I had very high expectations simply because the previous novel was so good. However, if you read Me Before You then you know, as I do now, it really was a stand alone story. There need not have been a follow up. This book feels like what we'd get if we got to see "happily ever after". It's not so...
      I was a bit confused at the beginning, but I ended up getting into it.
      As an aspiring storyteller, animator, and cartoonist I have nothing but respect for One Piece.
      2.5 to 3 stars<br /><br />Way too many typos in the Kindle edition, which prevented me from losing myself in the book. Hopefully the print edition doesn't have the same problem.
      3.5 stars<br />review to come
      When we first meet Elizabeth she is, a student in a Master’s program in Irish folklore, translating a book- The Book of Arranmore. Her mentoring professor has just passed away, she is broke and well life is just not grand. There is something strange about the book. Either it is strange or Elizabe...
      I guess I'm not a good reader because I only finish what I enjoy.
      This was okay. I liked that the heroine was so determined.
      I actually thought it was better than the first book.
      <strong>To quote the great Julius Caesar: Veni, Vidi, Vici (I came, I saw, I conquer).</strong> For me, Carry On wasn't anything special and I felt let down because of all the hype that surrounded it. I want to talk about the plot first.<br /><br />There was a lot of good moment in this book. I love the scenes between Simon...
      Loved this book, but you will need tissues at the end.
      nice short read
      I read the books in this series when I've visited the cities or they are a place I'm planning to visit. Memphis Noir falls in the latter category. This one is a little more supernatural than the others I've read. There are some real gems in this collection. Some hoodoo, some train rides, some foo...
      some stories are better than others, as with all collections of short stories. i read it when i was 16, perhaps i'd like it better a decade later?
      I liked this book but the movie adaptation was a real let down for the whole series.
      A nice end to the series, but after ten books in the universe I don't remember half the details and events referenced in the book. Quests and characters were mentioned that I was certain I'd never read about, which unfortunately resulted in me feeling like I was missing something important.
      Her story, plight and courage to fight and be heard against all odds deserve a five plus. Her passion for education from an early age truly inspiring. I rated it a three for the written book itself, good not outstanding. However, the book does have some good points on the history of Pakistan and...
       I'll Be There by Samantha Chase is the first book in this series that I have read and although the sixth in this series, it can be read as a standalone. <br /><br />Initially it was the cover that attracted me towards this book and had me checking our the blurb which again is very interesting and sure to ca...
      <strong>Cute</strong><br /><br />This book was really cute, I enjoyed it very much. It flowed nicely and ended quick. An easy, quick cute read. Glad I read it.
      Way too much of the snore-worthy love triangle stuff - I can't stand Eric or Heath so I really could care less who Zoey chooses, Stark is marginally more interesting - but the last few chapters are thrilling and set up the next book brilliantly.
      I'm not a big fan of Arnon Grunbergs' work. I think all his characters are a bit alike and repetitive.
      I enjoyed this one, but I think the comparisons to Gone Girl hurt the book My expectations were not met in that regard. But I do have to say, i thought the story held up well. The portrayal of the media was spot-on.
      I'm not sure how to rate this honestly. I liked the story and concept, but the first person present tense was a little wonky. I think the story would be better if it were written in third person.
      After everyone telling me this was the best book and I had to read it and waiting a year for a copy to actually be available, I finally read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. Although I found it entertaining, I was a bit disappointed in it after all of the hype and rave reviews that have followed t...
      I enjoyed this book, but not as much as would justify its wildly popular reputation. Perhaps I am a bit burnt out on post-apocalyptic stories, so this one, which is one of the earlier brand, does not strike me with the originality and interest it might once have done. I found the imagined world t...
      I read this book in two sittings, because it grabs your attention right off, and the last half is an endless stream of events. The middle slammed on the brakes and belabored setting the stage and building the world. I liked sharing our protagonist's confusion, but her decision making was maddenin...
      Ok this was a hard one for me to review. I had to think long and hard about how to write my review.<br />To start off, I enjoyed the overall storyline. I thought this was a really interesting and somewhat new story for me. BUT I felt that it was written way younger than I had expected. I felt like it w...
      ok read
      If you look up "Cozy Mystery" you will find this book as the definition. This is the first book I have read by Ms. Ross and really enjoyed the character Ms Julia. Maybe because she thinks like me :). All in all a good story and cozy mystery.
      Today I finished the LONG, 412 page novel by Cassandra King (who happens to be the wife of Pat Conroy, one of the most talented writers living today---If you have never read The Prince of Tides, it should be on your short list-----) called The Queen of Broken Hearts. The novel is set in Alabama a...
      Good story outline. The idea of the book was good, the way it was written not so much.
      This book ended the series for me. It was only OK. Quite scary for a bunch of angels going around killing each other and all kinds of terrifying creatures even though they were made of hot air. I'm done and if you feel the same way this book Kinda ties up the loose ends just well enough to move o...
      I still don't understand why they had to turn back into vampires
      For as much critical acclaim as this memoir got- it seemed.... pointless in the end. The author doesn't learn a lesson, nor does the reader. In the beginning, I found the writing thrilling and the escapades interesting- but soon grew tired of waiting for something to happen. It never did. Meh.
      I was vacillating between what the hell and this is fun the whole time. I'm still not sure how I really feel, other than I love to read an M/M urban fantasy that's not completely ridiculous.
      Good. Short. Kind of a unique take on fantasy - viking-ish world. <br /><br />Part of a trilogy, but really good as a stand alone. <br /><br />Under the journey narrative, there's a murder mystery that is resolved in an interesting way.
      I know it won the Pulitzer but I had a hard time relating or caring about the characters.
      Overly detailed in most parts of the book
      This book was okay. I guessed by page 50 that she would assist him with what he wanted. I didn't care for the mother at the end (but to give the author credit she kept the character consistent). I don't see what everyone is making such a big to do about this book. It was okay. A cheesy romance no...
      I liked it. Easy read. Not as good as the first book in this series. I thought "Frost" would have a more compelling story. I almost feel like the author lost her "oomph" for telling the stories of the last two friends in this series. Maybe there should have only been 4 or 5 friends instead of 7....
      Good, not the best.
      It started out promising. There were too many twists near the end for me to entirely enjoy it.
      I am really enjoying books by this author. For the 2nd book in this series, I think it was a stronger story than the first. I thought the heroine was completely believable. I liked how the father asked all three of them to take care of each other and that that was revealed towards the end of the...
      Just ok.
      I liked how Makenna and Colin's story unraveled. I felt a bit weird at the beginning knowing he had been married to her sister. Not sure of that part, but it worked out in the end. I will probably read more in this series.
      The story reminded me of Hans Christian Andersen's : "Swineherd," only Holly's story has a happier ending for her couple.
      I liked this one better than the other twin's story. I was a little surprised that the wedding was not the end of the story. I did like her epilogue for the story I know there are two more brother's, but I don't think this author has written their stories yet.
      3 1/2 stars. I like the way Iles writes and enjoy the characters. I have been reading the Penn Cage books out of order but I still enjoy the writing, the characters and the settings.
      Fun book at the beginning and end, but I didn't like what happens in the middle. It was weird. Also, the end just seems to come together really quickly. I bought the books as a package, so I'll read the second and third.
      It just ended, and it was sad.
      Total guilty pleasure. America is an idiot.
      Quick read. Not my favorite. Didn't really care about the characters.
      Just ok
      This was a quick read, left you feeling warm &amp; fuzzy. It is the second in this series (I did not read the first) but it was easily read as a stand alone. <br /><br />ARC provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.<br />
      This is not fiction, but her world is so completely different to mine it might as well be fiction. It did not engage me in the way that a good novel would - I am just not interested enough in who she is and what she has done, admirable although her writing achievements undoubtedly are.
      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />Fun little story to read, and actually a bit unpredictable. I would recommend it for a short read before bed.
      3.5<br />Didn't like the ending, should've been a bit longer, but other than that it was good! Very Gillian flynn, very suspenseful. Sucked me in a terrified me.<br />
      This book was interesting &amp; heartwarming, but I also feel like it was rushed. It's barely over 200 pages, and I feel like there are many aspects of the story that could have been expanded upon (particularly, character development). Perhaps I spent too much of this novel comparing it to My Nam...
      Rather a strange story and yet I kept reading on.
      It was cute. Predictable and a bit of an unsatisfactory ending, but cute. Middle grades would like this.
      <strong>Not worth your time</strong><br /><br />I am disciplined to read a book to conclusion. Not this one. Poorly edited. Jumps all around. I gave up at 60%. Don't waste your time.
      <strong>It was cool </strong><br /><br />I liked watching jack take a stand, not sure I agree with how his parents handled it but reading about some one standing up for theme self was cool
      This was a fun science fiction novel. Think Jack London meets MacGyver set in space. The narrator Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars, and he has to figure out how to survive on the unforgiving planet until he's rescued. Most of the plot is driven by engineering challenges Mark faces. He also ne...
      A nice tear-jerker romance. Thayne always writes well, and her characters are believable.
      *Slight Spoilers*<br /><br />This was an ok read. It wasn't what I was expecting. I've been reading this series from the beginning. And I have to say... I'm 50/50 about it.<br /><br />This book was a little bit on the serious side.<br />The pace of the book was kind of slow for me. I had a hard time connecting with Evren's ch...
      I struggled with Gone Girl - didn't have the desire to finish it. Gave Sharp Objects a try and finished it in just a few days!
      1st one all about sex...2nd one involves a bit of plot to justify all the sex.
      <strong>It's ok</strong><br /><br />The actual book stops at 5 percent. Yes 5 which was extremely short. There are about 7 bonus books after that story. A few were good but some I gave up on and skipped around. I should have read the reviews but the book that was supposed to be the main book was good.
      This book seems to be one in a series, and it behaves at times as if it is summarizing the others. In some ways it reminds me of those TV episodes where there is a flimsy new story, and lots of repeat scenes as padding. The style is where Lucky Campo tells a recorder what happened to him, and as...
      Not my favorite Jordan L Hawk novel. Still, the least of her stories is still the best of other authors so no real complaints. I just didn't connect with the characters in this one in the same way I did with her other series.
      Interesting mystery, but a little slow paced and not very intricate. I enjoyed Brother Bartholomew.
      This book definitely deserved that award. Full review at the final book.
      <strong>It delivers (but not much)</strong><br /><br />Promises a lot - and you do get more than nothing - but in the end you will need to invest cash of some unspecified amount to get some unmarketable fiction that you then need to invest in again to produce an untested manuscript to sell to an unidentified market. [Just po...
      Here's the thing- listening to this series, all I've really cared about is the wittiness. Between the narrator's delivery and Carringer's writing, there is some seriously clever dialogue. <br /><br />The story itself I could take or leave.<br /><br />But the overwhelming feeling I've gotten in each of these books is sim...
      Eh, this is a weak 3 stars. Just not as compelling as her Blackbirds book. <br /><br />Plus, the ending wasn't all that satisfying.
      Pretty good in some parts some of it gets verrry boring like the pearl
      <strong>The last of the three Holocaust novels</strong><br /><br />As with the previous two, speculative historical fiction based on fact. The focus draws much attention away from the normally thrilling Gabriel Allon, but we get a better picture of the Holocaust
      I was a bit sorry that Georgiana was not a real bluestocking, as a modern day one myself. But it was an enjoyable read.
      Suuuuuuuuuuper short but seems to be a kind of serial. I liked it (wee bit of insecurity and angst, chubby heroine), but read ahead the second one and then the plot summaies of the subsequent books and probably won't read 'em [spoilers removed]
      SLow moving
      Hi, my name is Nic, and I'm such an emotional marshmallow that actually cried reading Robin: Son of Batman.<br /><br />I'll link to my No Flying No Tights review once it's up.
      While good in parts with some paragraphs making me laugh aloud, it became very repetitive to read and I felt it dragged on for far too long. I'm sure the TV programme was much better. Also reading this on my Kindle was probably a bad idea- I'm sure the photos would've been much better in colour a...
      Sexy and sweet. This was a good conclusion to the Billionaire Bachelors Club. I was surprised that the author did not include an engagement between Matt and Brynn. (The hero/heroine from Savor) Overall it was still an enjoyable read.
      2.5 stars I like – or even love – a lot of the books I encounter. However, with some, the dream just doesn’t match the reality. Unfortunately, that was the case for me with The Red Door Inn. I really wanted to enjoy this novel, but it just didn’t come together and gel well for me. I picked this book up at first because of its Prince Edward Island setting. I love L.M. Montgomery’s books and stories, and I was curious to see the place through a modern author’s eyes. And in this respect, Johnson did deliver. Not surprisingly, there is more to Prince Edward Island than Anne of Green Gables, and I enjoyed learning more about the traditions of the place and some of the real difficulties of life there. If I ever make it up to PEI, I’m sure I will spend plenty of time daydreaming about favorite characters, but this novel outlined some of the natural beauty, folk art and other draws of the place as well. So, what exactly is this book all about? Well, as the novel opens, we meet Marie Carrington. She’s completely broke but determined to get to the island. Luckily, she encounters a kindly older man named Jack Sloane who helps pay her way across. She finds herself a job decorating Mr. Sloane’s soon-to-open B&B. When the two arrive at the inn, Jack’s nephew Seth Sloane is there as well. Well aware of his uncle’s trusting good nature, Seth is immediately suspicious of the lovely Marie. He figures she is a con artist who spotted Jack as an easy mark.So begins a cycle of Marie feeling inadequate, and Seth softening a big, then Marie shining as a decorator, then arousing Seth’s suspicions every time she spends a dime on decor. The constant seesawing between tentative friendship and suspicion goes on for well over 100 pages and I have to admit that I started to find it tiresome. I observed little development in terms of the character arcs for Marie and Seth at this point as well, and perhaps this added to the flatness I felt as I read.
      This book provides a guide to handling situations when you are under pressure.<br /><br />I found this book quite inspiring in places but it was too long winded (some of the anecdotes seemed irrelevant) and some of the advice / sections were a bit incoherent, if it had been a hundred pages shorter it could h...
      This book provides a straight forward guide to managing your money.<br /><br />The layout and print quality of this book was very good, but the advice was quite low level / simplistic and would probably only be good for people with very limited financial experience / knowledge.
      <strong>Super sweet</strong><br /><br />Super sweet quick read. Some loose ends but still satisfying. I like the Preor males more than the Ujal. Good read.
      <strong>Where oh where did Christine go</strong><br /><br />As the series has progressed more sex has crept in and less story. My favorite all time series has diminished into repetitive sex scenes and shrinking storyline. Trixie's story saved the whole book and kept it from being a waste of time. Even though Aleksei needed a...
      I loved the Q&amp;A a Day: 5 Year Journal by Potter Style and have been using it every day for over a year. So, when I saw this was available for free in exchange for a review on Blogging for Books, I knew I had to request it. This journal is very interesting, and in the sort of style of Wreck Th...
      Educational and upsetting. her voice lulled me to sleep... very hard to get through it.
      Erotic and extremely sexy, surprisingly good story line it was a good read all around. Author should definitely keep writing with nice story lines like this one.
      More sympathetic protagonist than any of the characters in Gone Girl.
      Interesting story, nicely written.
      I did enjoy the stories in this work, but the Jacob/Esau-type brothers were rather too clear cut to be believable.
      More conventional than the first volume. This time, Graham and company make room for frivolities like "supporting characters" and "dialog." I miss the alien minimalism of the first volume, but this is still one of the most intriguing of the recent Image books.
      Although this is a great book, reading it as a child scared me !!
      Much better than the animated film. The book is lushly illustrated and the story follows the novel series.
      My heart hurt for this nurse, raising an abandoned baby in the turmoil of post WWII.
      The story is set in 1741 London and the neighborhood around Harte's Folly.<br />Hoyt's plot has some darker elements, however, it is still a very sexy romance.<br />The accompanying fairytale is not as detailed, but suites the tone of the story.
      Kyra is a young thief. When a mysterious man named James makes her a risky offer, Kyra reluctantly accepts.<br />A fantasy adventure with a very interesting heroine.
      Anna is a foster child who gets the opportunity to spend the summer in a Norfolk village.<br />Robinson's plot has themes of friendship mixed with a little ghostly mystery.<br />A good read for Halloween.<br />
      Liked the writing and characters of this book, but am never fond of insta love especially when course of book essentially happens over a weekend - I like more of a believeable build up. That aside, strong 3 star read.
      <strong>I enjoyed this book</strong><br /><br />It wasn't great but it had some really good parts and I love the way the author put tenderness between the couple. Some authors don't know how to do that but this author has it down to a science. The reason why I didn't give this story more stars is because I don't like stories...
      Sensitively presented book talks about death and loss of a loved one.
      This was a cute little story - the Yo Gabba Gabba gang loooove their favourite colours. Wouldn't it be awesome if *everything* in their world was that colour? <br />The kiddos learn the age-old lesson about variety being what makes things interesting, as well as having the different colours named, show...
      it was ok. not the best not the worst.
      I think I enjoyed this a little more than I really should have.<br /><br />Oh dear.
      "Holly is grieving the loss of her husband. He leaves his wife a gift, which touchingly helps Holly move toward rebuilding a new life. The book could have an obvious ending, thankfully, it does not."
      I don't know. I was expecting something racier for a start. This is an angst-ridden coming of age story that takes Punpun through approx. two years of his life starting with his father nearly killing his mother in a domestic dispute, spending time with his uncle while father is in jail and mother...
      A wordy but charming book, along the lines of Anne of Green Gables or Little House on the Prairie. It has a cozy narrator feature.
      One of the lessons from the global financial crisis (known in the US as the Great Recession) is that people can confuse the improbable with the impossible. As Taleb argues, "Black Swan logic makes what you don't know far more relevant that what you do know."<br />The author's insistence on inserting hi...

      Not thrilled with the amount of profanity and what I feel was prurient sex. It's an interesting idea and I wouldn't NOT recommend it. Just give some caveats.
      Auggie is privileged and the daughter of a wealthy equine family in Kentucky.

Bent on embarrassing his father, Worthington LaViere III uses his position as a highly respected...
      I read this years ago, but as with all Marry Higgins Clark, it was well written and fast paced, a good story.
      Audio version. A few slow moments, but the ending hooked me. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment! Grades 7 and up.
      I picked this book up at the library. It's colorful and caught my eye... and somewhere in the back of my mind I started thinking 'prom time' and 'need hair ideas'. Not for myself, by the way, but for my daughter and her BFFs.<br /><br />What you'll find inside are 34 fancy hair styles with photos and instruc...
      This is a bit of a contrived story and I thought a bit silly, however, it was a good way to spend an evening sick in bed. Didn't take too much concentration. If you are a Jane Austen fan you might enjoy.<br />
      There is a ghost but that's just peripheral. The real heat is between Jade and Kane.
      The story seemed rather episodic, with some kind of "big bad" plot hinted at in the background. Even though the main character struggled with a serious health problem, the resolution wasn't very interesting. The ending, when the "big bad" finally interacted with the rest of the characters, made u...
      The story really picked up towards the end but overall this was not my favourite of the series. I'm torn because I really feel like the books are becoming ridiculous, but I really love the characters and look forward to reading more about them. Hopefully the next book is better.
      Charming read about an elderly man dealing with his wife's death starting on the first anniversary, when he discovers a charm bracelet he didn't know she had. He begins a search to find out about he charms, and about this side of his wife's life that he knew nothing about.
      A bit strange pacing-wise. I was enjoying the were war and I love the Alcide character but that plotline was over way too quickly only to be replaced by the way less interesting (and also tied up too soon) vamp stand-off. Still, I really enjoy these books and can easily while away an entire after...
      Mashup of OJ and Bill Clinton is not saved by the return of Nick Naylor. The fact that Buckley, supposedly a consummate Washingtonian, misplaces Georgetown Law by 32 blocks is impossible to avoid.
      did not like Trent.
      2.5<br />It was an ok read or listen in my case. I'm not sure if it's because it was an audiobook or what but I didn't really enjoy the story. I felt like there was too many unnecessary things in the story.
      <strong>Okay read</strong><br /><br />I read half of the book and enjoyed it mostly. I jumped to the end because I got bored with it. Well written logically laid out. Not too wordy, just not gripping.
      I ultimately enjoyed this story, but it starts off quite slowly and by the end there's so much crammed into the last few chapters that it's a bit difficult to process. I like Bleeker's writing style and enjoyed her other novel, Wreckage, but I felt that the pacing on this one was off. I wish she'...
      <strong>Amazingly...</strong><br /><br />This book was actually better than the first book. I didn't bother reading the second book on the series. The first was one was so horrible I couldn't even finish it.
      Graphic Novel version of the story, I find the story of Jane Eyre to be overrated
      Mildly amusing. I found the constant Holmes references irritating, and Robert &amp; Hugh superfluous, but the story was reasonably entertaining. Holly was very slow on the uptake regarding the missing dog. I would like to know how Tracker the cat gets on, &amp; whether Rowdy &amp; Kimi accept her...
      Blaylock's plot pays homage to Vern and Poe, while at the same time, he also has a great deal of fun.
      The plot is set in Middle Anglia, Eastern Britain, 631 AD. Essa and his father, Cai have the unique position of being slightly outside the clan while still having social connections.<br />Moran blends historical detail with fantasy to create a fascinating story.
      Mann's plot is primarily a murder mystery, although it does have the prerequisite trappings associated with Steampunk. The murders featured in the story are similar to the Jack the Ripper case.
      Loved it!
      Not really wanting to read the next book, except am curious of the new addition. With this book I skimmed it a lot it's has lost my interest.

      More of a 3.5/3.75. The art is awesome and the humor is on point. I'll probably check out more of Julia's books.

      I found this book very interesting.
      Light and simple tale of how a community becomes family. We're all a little broken, but heal when we support one another.
      Heartbreaking.
      Funny.
      I liked this book, but I wanted to see the shooter's perspective. Heather's part was not worth reading, and same with Jason's.
      a little too convenient for scarpetta. Cornwall spends a lot of time with descriptions that don't move the plot forward. everything too easy for scarpetta
      Only read the first story didn't old much interest. I thought the book was a full novel with a bonus book at the end. I was disappointed to find that was not the case. I thought the story was too rushed might have been better it the story had been longer. I enjoy reads were I feel like I can amer...
      build up was great, the climax and finish, made me feel like I was left hanging, with no solid conclusion. overall, good book
      cute
      This was a quick novella. I got it for 99 cents and I highly enjoyed it. It might make me read more by this author. I liked how the hero and heroine still married even though her dowry became an issue.
      I liked this story until the end of part 3. I was getting very upset with the protagonist. I didn't feel bad for her and I began to not like her. At the beginning I understood why she was the way she was and why she acted like she did. I got mad when she had all the opportunities and she basicall...
      Story in rhyme would work well for a Bedtime / Pajama storytime. Not as compelling or informative as Goodnight Construction site, but it could add as a supplemental book to accompany that one in a theme storytime on trucks for younger children.
      Interesting stories - some of them are heartwarming.
      <br />Have you ever been in an illustrious relationship while married? Have you ever fallen in love with the side man?<br /><br />Malaya is a successful wife, mother, and lawyer. She has her own practice and to the outside world, things look amazing. She is married to Trent and on the inside of their world, things...
      Who doesn't love a cowboy love story?
      Me and my brothers like the facts.
      Martin seems to barrow from Tolkien especially the second book in the series that deals with a siege war. The other influence seems to be the television series: "The Walking Dead."<br />So far this plot has the most pessimistic outlook so far.
      Police drama/thriller. It was a good story. The writing was a bit redundant and annoying at times.
      Kind of slow, like the other books.
      I liked the last book in the trilogy the least as it felt like pages and pages could have been taken out just re-stating what had happened in the last books. I ended up skipping junks of the chapters because of it.
      The book was pretty boring at first, but then the end came along and it made the slow start worthwhile.
      In the follow-up to The Unnaturalist, Syrus Reed narrates the events shortly after the conclusion of the first story.<br />Part of the plot seems inspired by the Chinese Terracotta warriors.<br />This story is more firmly rooted in Steampunk than the first.
      A collection of short stories. My personal favorites are: "Bombshells" by Jim Butcher and "Second Arabesque, very slow" by Nancy Kress. Butcher's story is the lightest in the collection with its dark sense of humor and use of Star Wars puns. Kress' dystopian story reminds the reader that there is...
      When an oceanliner sinks, a baby in a cello case is rescued in the river. An exciting and unique look at Paris via its rooftops.
       Chess figures prominately in the plot, drawing comparison to: Alice adventures through the Looking Glass. There is even a large talking cat to add to the similarity.
      I am sudying public speaking in front of audience,I think this book will help me alot
      A very enjoyable biography of a little-known Black poet. Lovely photos. Would have liked it better if more of his poetry was included.
      I enjoyed the first two-thirds of the book but it was downhill after that.
      <strong>Realistic story Line</strong><br /><br />It took a long time to catch my interest. I enjoyed the glimpse into New York City terror realities and dangers.
      <strong>Okay</strong><br /><br />This was an okay story; although not my favorite. I enjoyed the creatures, though. I felt they were very original. The story itself was quite original, as well, though I felt it lacked the proper pizzazz needed to make it great. All in all, a decent effort.
      It was a good start, but a bit choppy as everyone was introduced. I'll keep reading in trade, as the art is excellent.
      Meh, it was okay.
      More of the same. Good and fun enough to keep reading.
      Muted illustrations.
      <strong>Strange ideas</strong><br /><br />I would read the disclaimer in this book before trying any of the remedies. Some of the stuff in this book is good, but other things need to be ignored because I believe it could really make someone unhealthy. Buddhists don't eat onions and therefore should not use onions in their ha...
      A very interesting story! But a little slow in some parts.
      This book was cute, but there wasn't a whole lot to set it apart from the hundreds of other "new big sibling" books out there. The illustrations were cute, and I liked how it addressed the jealousy issue without dismissing it - but also talked about the things older siblings can do that little on...
      This one was pretty good. Still really short and not a whole lot of story. But for a short story it hit the mark.
      I’ve finally finished 'Salem’s Lot by Stephen King. It seems like Stephen King has two kinds of books for me. There are the novels that I can’t put down and have read hundreds of times, and then there are the books that take me months to slog through and I may never read again. Unfortunately, 'Sa...

      Love Alice Hoffman, but found this one less interesting. Hard to finish, main character not likable.
      Xandra is trying to deal with her new fame as the goblin queen, when her brother Val goes missing. The plot is more paranormal in nature and not true Steampunk, in my oppinon.
      Got this for a dollar. Almost too fluffy...but I will probably read the others in this series.
      I read all of this author's books. This was the 8th in the series, I believe. Her books are easy to read and with the ending of the school year I need light and easy reading.
      Hiccup is back and this time he is on a Quest to find a Jewel which in the wrong hands would destroy all dragons. Hiccup is getting older and it has been a lot of fun reading his adventures and see the character change.
      Gavin and Callie had an interesting love story. I wasn't sure at the beginning of the story how this story was proceeding with the sea battle. It became clear near the end of the story. As I read the story, I kept trying to remember the Duke of Rothwell's story since I had read the book and his c...
      There were parts of this that were good. Overall it was just OK. I think I'm done with my YA kick for awhile. Need something new and more grown up to read. All I really have to say is that this was a bit unrealistic in that the school completely dropped the ball and I cannot believe anyone's pare...
      "The Shattered Crown” by J.W. Webb was an entertaining tale that I read in just a few evenings. It delivers on so many levels, but the most important one to me personally was that it was fun. Not blood and gore fun or deeply philosophical fun, though I do appreciate those types of stories as well...
      <strong>Okay Romance, Highly Unethical Research!</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed Carolyn Brown's The PMS Club, so I thought I'd give this a whirl. It's a sweet story about two people with the wrong impression of each other who (surprise, surprise) fall in love. It's set against an Oklahoma backdrop, which I thought worked well...
      something influenced by soviet confrontation.
      fast paced and exciting magic fun times. i made noises. intrigued about where this story is going. to the sequel!
      This is the first graphic novel I have ever read, and I would never have picked it up if it weren’t for the #VTReadingChallenge, in which “a graphic novel” is one of the categories. I stood, hesitatingly, in front of the shelves of adult graphic novels at my library. Everything looked strange, an...
      Decent romance
      Most of this seemed very obvious to me, but unfortunately it's a much needed message. Well-written, without being negative or judgemental, a good read for parents of pre-schoolers. Skimming is made easy by short and clearly labeled sections.
      Oddly, I didn't like the revised and longer version of this. I thought the initial version was sweeter, the new version wasn't as awesome.
      <strong>Could have used some better relationship development.</strong><br /><br />I liked this book, didn't love it. I felt it skipped the necessary components required when falling in love with your characters and rooting for them or their relationships with others. Would like to have read more of AJ and Amelias courtship,...
      An entertaining read with interesting characters.
      This was a bit of a morality tale. It was ok but not the best I've ever read. I did enjoy the art work though.
      This series started out as a decent escapist sort of fiction, within an interesting and creative world. I may just really be too old to appreciate this one- I found it boring.
      Lesson is a tad heavy-handed.
      <strong>Formatting problem</strong><br /><br />Every chapter the first page is missing or cut short off the top. I figured it out by adjusting the size of the font. But I could never get all of the page. And I had to make the font larger to get more of the page. So, while I've just started the book I thinking getting into it...
      Fun, fluffy read before Christmas. I liked all four short stories.
      It was okay. A little too mystical for my tastes...
      The story line was completely different than what I thought it would be. I liked both the characters of Brenna and Michael.
      <strong>Nice reading</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed reading 2 books in this series. It was page turner from beginning to end. I will be reading more from this author. Excellent writing Christine!!<br />
      Decent writing and a good story, but I must admit that I got some of the characters mixed up - they weren't developed enough for me to quickly visualize them.
      Thriller Romance...just a fun read
      The second half of this book is a straightforward, comprehensible commentary on the book of Esther (despite the fact that it is more than 1000 years old). Because it is a PhD thesis, it contains a huge amount of background, so most of the first half of the book is only of interest to specialists....
      ok theme...faded at end
      It's an interesting "thriller," but lengthy and fragmented with the past/present and varying narrators. By the end of the story, I was relieved it had ended.
      Too short. Wish there was more, but I LOVE Mira's writing style.
      Very boring
      You'll think it is cheesy (heaving bosoms and shifting petticoats, embarrassing dialogue...) - and then you can't put it down!
      the ending was interesting. As too much of my life has been spent living with alcoholism and the behaviors I had a hard time with the alcoholic behavior in the book. other than that it was good.
      This book foreshadows and summarizes events from another book from the incarnations of immortality. The devil was more godlike than god himself.
      Short and sweet scifi novel. Many good moments packed into this little book.
      An interesting book, that I chose off the "new book" shelf, at the library. The book started off a little slowly, but picked up significantly toward the end. Turns out, that this is the fifth book, in Mr. Ifkovic's series, and I haven't decided yet, whether I'll go and read the others. Investigat...
      The book was not as interesting as the first two. I enjoyed the ending though and thought it was very fitting for the story that was being told and the way Tris' character developed through the series.
      This book is OK, and the photographs are certainly... er... graphic.
      Loved it (mostly). The story of Felicia Day's quirky, nonconformist upbringing left me laughing and ready to close the book, jump up and do something amazing and unexpected. But by the back half, where we get caught up in Felicia's Hollywood world of meetings and marketing, I felt less like I cou...
      Not really what I was expecting but it was still an alright book. It wasn't particularly long so probably wasn't worth the money and I felt a lot of the examples containing the numbers mentioned were like that out of coincidence, not because they meant anything special- more like the number is co...
      For the first half of this book reading was a great effort and I not only found the language difficult to understand (the book is now celebrating it's 200th anniversary) but I found the characters hard to keep up with and found myself needing a who's who list. After that the book got better and I...
      Would be five stars but the ending left me so disappointed.
      The fourth book of an amazing series. This time it felt like going home, like putting on my comfiest pyjamas and chatting with old friends. The plot is great and keeps you in suspense right through, not only are you routing for the love connections to happen but also to find out the secrets of Po...
      The is the second book by Reynolds I've read that completely disregards the adage that a YA story must be All About Plot. Unlike the knitting one, I did not get bored and enjoyed wandering through these character's lives, and especially liked attending so many interesting funerals.
      Doman references Christian symbolism in her modern version of Snow White. She also references Alice's adventures through the looking glass.
      I read an advanced copy that I found at the San Bernardino City library. I liked the concept and the use of Greek mythology.
      Well, having read the first book in this series, ‘Did I Mention I Love You?’, I was hoping that Eden’s two timing, cheating ways would be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case and continue unabated in this second story in the trilogy.<br /><br />The setting of New York City is explored bril...
      I loved this book but some how could not connect with it - They had took a true story and changed and twisted it. Usualy I like this but I don't know, it just felt a bit wrong. However, the actual book is amazing, and a very descriptive and truthful account of the holocaust and concentration camp...
      A nice, fast read with a steady plot. <br /><br />Josh and Carissa had met some time ago before he was deployed. When he returns, she’s now been with his friend. They all have a code, No One goes with a friend’s ex. So ensues the drama.<br /><br />I like second chance romance, but I’m not sure I see why they felt they h...
      Meh, wasn't the worst read in high school.
      WARNING: This is NOT a Dark Romance<br /><br />2 1/2 Stars rounded to 3<br /><br />I am quite upset after reading the authors blurb saying this was a Dark Romance, to find it is NOT!!!!<br /><br />I struggled trying to read this book as I found it quite boring and it was all over the place.<br />.
      Okay, so I was lured by the delicious-looking blueberries on the cover. This was light and sweet, and, yes, a bit unrealistic but I did enjoy the story of a successful NYC attorney who visits her grandmother's hometown in Maine only to (literally) fall for the local guy. What is she doing? She ha...
      Terrifying.
      Quirky and unique but don't know if a kid would sit though the whole thing. Has a great message and an interesting mix of illustrations and photographs though!
      The Minnesota connection kept it going for me.
      An easy read - finished it in an afternoon for our school's Battle of the Books tournament. I did like how the kids got involved in the publishing process. Kind of cool. I wish that Andrew Clements would write "The Cheater" now, with the pseudonym Cassandra Day. That would be awesome.
      Very refreshing to read something written long before we all became so politically correct. Some good ideas to try to fall asleep more quickly without resorting to pills.
      I think the writing style here really let down what could've been a very good short novel. At times it was impossible to tell who was speaking in a section of dialogue and the fact that different chapters were narrated by different characters in such a short book meant that you never really knew...
      Definitely not as good as The Psychopath Test, but I think that's just because the whole book is full of people who so strongly believe in things that I find ridiculous. Jon Ronson is a good author and storyteller, and I'll be reading more of his books in the future!
      <strong>Ok for a quick read.</strong><br /><br />Honestly there's nothing to really sink your teeth into. Yes, we learn more about Jenna and Melissa. I wonder if an intelligent woman would be so quick to dismiss the questionable relationship between Jenna and Stephanie. It left me saying: REALLY?
       I have to say that Bend Me, Break Me was a good book, but I just couldn't get into it the way I wanted to. So going into this book, I definitely had no idea exactly what the book was about because the blurb was pretty vague. I really like going into books when the blurb is vague because it reall...
      Got this as a free ARC from Netgalley. This was my first time reading about asexuals. Found it interesting. One thing I disliked about the book was the "instant love" that is in so many romance booxs, even though there was no sex. I did like the explanation of the main characters life, how she tr...
      This deserves more than 3 stars, so I say 3.5. It was an interesting read, definitely a deep space scifi. There were a few boring, long and confusing parts, and some characters weren't very relatable, but I think all in all I like it. I'll read the next book in a month after I have a break from t...
      While an interesting premise, I didn’t enjoy the writer’s writing style (personal preference) and, therefore, did not enjoy the book. In addition, I found it distracting when the words broke across lines.
      Life in the Cascade Mountains with a local newspaper editor and her staff. A murder to spice things up
      Good Start to a story but there is very little conflict and what there is is summed up in like 2 chapters. Really would have liked to seen this drawn out a little more but would read the next in line for sure.
      Mmmm...This lady has written her own perceptions and experiences. Mostly swirling around 'Infosys' and it's organizing activities. Each having their own perception. Not so different !! Once simply can read.
      The book starts slow and keeps a steady pace. We are transported into the 60's in Hazard, Kentucky and follow the budding romance of Owen and Sarah. That's all it is, really. One normal event after another brings them together or apart. The author teases you with shape shifting and that there are...
      Waited for years and years for this book. And I had to high expectations. It was a let down. :(
      I liked the tormented part that our hero played. You could feel his emotions given, but I think it got lost on our heroine. You never really get what she looks like? You get hair color but "body type" is not really there. Not bad otherwise and very few, if any typos
      The Line is an incredibly subtle and playful wordless picturebook which draws a story made simply of an imaginative interaction between a young child and a drawn pencil line. The main character discovers the power a simple line has to be transformative; becoming curvy, looping in circles and evol...
      The plot references the television series: 24 and The Thomas Crown Affair.<br />Opal Koboi is set on getting revenge against the LEPercon squad, specifically Holly Short and Root. Artemis could help, except his memory has been erased.<br />
      I think this was a fantastic book, however, somehow it doesn't capture the great idea that I think this book could have been. The concepts are fantastic the concepts are fantastic, along with the ideas. Somehow I struggled with the way that the story was delivered.
      A really interesting book and I loved the writing style of the author. However, I did find the book incredibly depressing and was actually hoping for a happy ending. When I finished reading the book I felt that nothing had actually been resolved at the end and that the entire book had essentially...
      There are some books that have such a great plot that I'd like to wholeheartedly recommend them, but they also have an abundance of language, sexual references, and other objectionable material. This book was one of those. I would have given it 5 stars if I could cut out a few parts.
      I liked the idea of having the major twist in the middle of the book- I thought this worked very well and was quite original. However the ending completely ruined this for me, this couldn't compete with books like Mercy and Before I Go to Sleep. I wasn't expecting a 'happy' ending but I'm a bit d...
      <strong>Uh huh...</strong><br /><br />This was a (very) short erotic interlude between a husband and wife who are trying to put some spice back into their sex lives. It was an okay read.
