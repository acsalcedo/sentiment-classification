      A very enjoyable biography of a little-known Black poet. Lovely photos. Would have liked it better if more of his poetry was included.
      Talks about the culture of violence in America and what it means to some people, why they stick with it, and how to undermine it. Focuses mainly on how to give kids, who have been soaking in violence like teabags all their lives in the inner cities, a shot at seeing the world differently. You sho...
      Another timely topic, concussions. Told from two perspectives. Well written.
      <br />This biography of the "sexologists" Masters and Johnson that lead to the hit tv series of the same name. It was interesting to learn more about their groundbreaking research and life in St. Louis. Equally interesting is their personal lives...before they became "Masters and Johnson" and eventuall...
      I had very high expectations simply because the previous novel was so good. However, if you read Me Before You then you know, as I do now, it really was a stand alone story. There need not have been a follow up. This book feels like what we'd get if we got to see "happily ever after". It's not so...
      1st one all about sex...2nd one involves a bit of plot to justify all the sex.
      <strong>It's ok</strong><br /><br />The actual book stops at 5 percent. Yes 5 which was extremely short. There are about 7 bonus books after that story. A few were good but some I gave up on and skipped around. I should have read the reviews but the book that was supposed to be the main book was good.

      Pretty good in some parts some of it gets verrry boring like the pearl
      This book provides a guide to handling situations when you are under pressure.<br /><br />I found this book quite inspiring in places but it was too long winded (some of the anecdotes seemed irrelevant) and some of the advice / sections were a bit incoherent, if it had been a hundred pages shorter it could h...
      This book provides a straight forward guide to managing your money.<br /><br />The layout and print quality of this book was very good, but the advice was quite low level / simplistic and would probably only be good for people with very limited financial experience / knowledge.
      2.5 rounds up to 3 stars
      I liked this book, but I wanted to see the shooter's perspective. Heather's part was not worth reading, and same with Jason's.
      a little too convenient for scarpetta. Cornwall spends a lot of time with descriptions that don't move the plot forward. everything too easy for scarpetta
      Only read the first story didn't old much interest. I thought the book was a full novel with a bonus book at the end. I was disappointed to find that was not the case. I thought the story was too rushed might have been better it the story had been longer. I enjoy reads were I feel like I can amer...
      This was a fun science fiction novel. Think Jack London meets MacGyver set in space. The narrator Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars, and he has to figure out how to survive on the unforgiving planet until he's rescued. Most of the plot is driven by engineering challenges Mark faces. He also ne...
      Not thrilled with the amount of profanity and what I feel was prurient sex. It's an interesting idea and I wouldn't NOT recommend it. Just give some caveats.
      <strong>Okay</strong><br /><br />This was an okay story; although not my favorite. I enjoyed the creatures, though. I felt they were very original. The story itself was quite original, as well, though I felt it lacked the proper pizzazz needed to make it great. All in all, a decent effort.
      It was a good start, but a bit choppy as everyone was introduced. I'll keep reading in trade, as the art is excellent.
      Meh, it was okay.

      More of the same. Good and fun enough to keep reading.
      This is a bit of a contrived story and I thought a bit silly, however, it was a good way to spend an evening sick in bed. Didn't take too much concentration. If you are a Jane Austen fan you might enjoy.<br />
      There is a ghost but that's just peripheral. The real heat is between Jade and Kane.
      The story seemed rather episodic, with some kind of "big bad" plot hinted at in the background. Even though the main character struggled with a serious health problem, the resolution wasn't very interesting. The ending, when the "big bad" finally interacted with the rest of the characters, made u...
      Mashup of OJ and Bill Clinton is not saved by the return of Nick Naylor. The fact that Buckley, supposedly a consummate Washingtonian, misplaces Georgetown Law by 32 blocks is impossible to avoid.
      did not like Trent.
      Postuumi kokoelma ja läpileikkaus Tonin tuotantoon. Muistutus siitä, että aina asiat eivät järjesty.
      2.5<br />It was an ok read or listen in my case. I'm not sure if it's because it was an audiobook or what but I didn't really enjoy the story. I felt like there was too many unnecessary things in the story.
