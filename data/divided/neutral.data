      A very enjoyable biography of a little-known Black poet. Lovely photos. Would have liked it better if more of his poetry was included.
      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />Fun little story to read, and actually a bit unpredictable. I would recommend it for a short read before bed.
      3.5<br />Didn't like the ending, should've been a bit longer, but other than that it was good! Very Gillian flynn, very suspenseful. Sucked me in a terrified me.<br />

      This book was interesting &amp; heartwarming, but I also feel like it was rushed. It's barely over 200 pages, and I feel like there are many aspects of the story that could have been expanded upon (particularly, character development). Perhaps I spent too much of this novel comparing it to My Nam...
      Rather a strange story and yet I kept reading on.
      Gwen Dylan isn't what one would normally think of when zombies come to mind. She holds down a job, sure, it's as a gravedigger but how else is she supposed to get access to brains? The brains taste awful but eating them is a small price to pay once a month to hold onto who she is and to keep her...
      This story has it all: time travel, sexy Scottish Lairds and castles, evil Sorcerers, magic treasure, an Elfin Queen, archeological digs, and of course a damsel in distress. There was so much packed into this story that it was a bit difficult to keep all the storylines straight. There is a backst...
      The book is written in a very interesting style, that I found easy and quick to read. I thought the style was good for a short book, but for a longer novel or rereads it may get annoying.
      I enjoyed this book. I will recommend this book to everyone.
      Interesting topic, 200 pages too long.
      Enjoyed this from Con's POV, a little drawn out, but worth the read. The 'family' are wonderful characters, loved the boys.
      I can't help it. I love these things. So predictable, but still so very much fun. The sex scenes are a little long for me and I still love 'em
      How/why we drifted into being a war machine with no end in sight. It is a sad state. Read and discuss. You will also find about our nuclear status and just where are those bombs? They are where? Yes! Good grief indeed. Should we not know this? ..........we should not be in the dark.
      Talks about the culture of violence in America and what it means to some people, why they stick with it, and how to undermine it. Focuses mainly on how to give kids, who have been soaking in violence like teabags all their lives in the inner cities, a shot at seeing the world differently. You sho...
      Another timely topic, concussions. Told from two perspectives. Well written.
      <br />This biography of the "sexologists" Masters and Johnson that lead to the hit tv series of the same name. It was interesting to learn more about their groundbreaking research and life in St. Louis. Equally interesting is their personal lives...before they became "Masters and Johnson" and eventuall...
      I had very high expectations simply because the previous novel was so good. However, if you read Me Before You then you know, as I do now, it really was a stand alone story. There need not have been a follow up. This book feels like what we'd get if we got to see "happily ever after". It's not so...
      Graphic Novel version of the story, I find the story of Jane Eyre to be overrated
      Mildly amusing. I found the constant Holmes references irritating, and Robert &amp; Hugh superfluous, but the story was reasonably entertaining. Holly was very slow on the uptake regarding the missing dog. I would like to know how Tracker the cat gets on, &amp; whether Rowdy &amp; Kimi accept her...
      This is the one about the identity thief with the creepy son who preyed upon Kinsey's elderly neighbor.
      some stories are better than others, as with all collections of short stories. i read it when i was 16, perhaps i'd like it better a decade later?
      I liked this book but the movie adaptation was a real let down for the whole series.
      كل شئ نعتقد اننا نسيناه يستوطن اعماقنا،في ذلك الصندوق الذي ما ان يفتح حتي تتغير كل قوانيين الطبيعه ،يولد الماضي في الحاضر،يبعث الاموات من جديد،وتتصبب اجسادنا عرقا في برد الشتاء ،وترتعش بردا في حر الصيف.<br /><br />عبد العزيز عشريني ،يعيش وحيدا مع ماضيه ،ما بين فتره الطفوله والاحتلال (حادثة مقتل والده)،ومن ثم...

      A nice end to the series, but after ten books in the universe I don't remember half the details and events referenced in the book. Quests and characters were mentioned that I was certain I'd never read about, which unfortunately resulted in me feeling like I was missing something important.

      Her story, plight and courage to fight and be heard against all odds deserve a five plus. Her passion for education from an early age truly inspiring. I rated it a three for the written book itself, good not outstanding. However, the book does have some good points on the history of Pakistan and...
      <strong>Okay read</strong><br /><br />I read half of the book and enjoyed it mostly. I jumped to the end because I got bored with it. Well written logically laid out. Not too wordy, just not gripping.
      I ultimately enjoyed this story, but it starts off quite slowly and by the end there's so much crammed into the last few chapters that it's a bit difficult to process. I like Bleeker's writing style and enjoyed her other novel, Wreckage, but I felt that the pacing on this one was off. I wish she'...
      <strong>Amazingly...</strong><br /><br />This book was actually better than the first book. I didn't bother reading the second book on the series. The first was one was so horrible I couldn't even finish it.
      I'm not a big fan of Arnon Grunbergs' work. I think all his characters are a bit alike and repetitive.
      I enjoyed this one, but I think the comparisons to Gone Girl hurt the book My expectations were not met in that regard. But I do have to say, i thought the story held up well. The portrayal of the media was spot-on.
      I'm not sure how to rate this honestly. I liked the story and concept, but the first person present tense was a little wonky. I think the story would be better if it were written in third person.
      After everyone telling me this was the best book and I had to read it and waiting a year for a copy to actually be available, I finally read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. Although I found it entertaining, I was a bit disappointed in it after all of the hype and rave reviews that have followed t...
      I enjoyed this book, but not as much as would justify its wildly popular reputation. Perhaps I am a bit burnt out on post-apocalyptic stories, so this one, which is one of the earlier brand, does not strike me with the originality and interest it might once have done. I found the imagined world t...
      I read this book in two sittings, because it grabs your attention right off, and the last half is an endless stream of events. The middle slammed on the brakes and belabored setting the stage and building the world. I liked sharing our protagonist's confusion, but her decision making was maddenin...
      Ok this was a hard one for me to review. I had to think long and hard about how to write my review.<br />To start off, I enjoyed the overall storyline. I thought this was a really interesting and somewhat new story for me. BUT I felt that it was written way younger than I had expected. I felt like it w...

      If you look up "Cozy Mystery" you will find this book as the definition. This is the first book I have read by Ms. Ross and really enjoyed the character Ms Julia. Maybe because she thinks like me :). All in all a good story and cozy mystery.
      Good. Short. Kind of a unique take on fantasy - viking-ish world. <br /><br />Part of a trilogy, but really good as a stand alone. <br /><br />Under the journey narrative, there's a murder mystery that is resolved in an interesting way.
      I know it won the Pulitzer but I had a hard time relating or caring about the characters.
      Overly detailed in most parts of the book

      1st one all about sex...2nd one involves a bit of plot to justify all the sex.
      <strong>It's ok</strong><br /><br />The actual book stops at 5 percent. Yes 5 which was extremely short. There are about 7 bonus books after that story. A few were good but some I gave up on and skipped around. I should have read the reviews but the book that was supposed to be the main book was good.
      This book seems to be one in a series, and it behaves at times as if it is summarizing the others. In some ways it reminds me of those TV episodes where there is a flimsy new story, and lots of repeat scenes as padding. The style is where Lucky Campo tells a recorder what happened to him, and as...
      Not my favorite Jordan L Hawk novel. Still, the least of her stories is still the best of other authors so no real complaints. I just didn't connect with the characters in this one in the same way I did with her other series.
      Interesting mystery, but a little slow paced and not very intricate. I enjoyed Brother Bartholomew.
      This book definitely deserved that award. Full review at the final book.
      <strong>It delivers (but not much)</strong><br /><br />Promises a lot - and you do get more than nothing - but in the end you will need to invest cash of some unspecified amount to get some unmarketable fiction that you then need to invest in again to produce an untested manuscript to sell to an unidentified market. [Just po...
      Here's the thing- listening to this series, all I've really cared about is the wittiness. Between the narrator's delivery and Carringer's writing, there is some seriously clever dialogue. <br /><br />The story itself I could take or leave.<br /><br />But the overwhelming feeling I've gotten in each of these books is sim...
      Eh, this is a weak 3 stars. Just not as compelling as her Blackbirds book. <br /><br />Plus, the ending wasn't all that satisfying.

      This book provides a guide to handling situations when you are under pressure.<br /><br />I found this book quite inspiring in places but it was too long winded (some of the anecdotes seemed irrelevant) and some of the advice / sections were a bit incoherent, if it had been a hundred pages shorter it could h...
      This book provides a straight forward guide to managing your money.<br /><br />The layout and print quality of this book was very good, but the advice was quite low level / simplistic and would probably only be good for people with very limited financial experience / knowledge.

      I liked this book, but I wanted to see the shooter's perspective. Heather's part was not worth reading, and same with Jason's.
      a little too convenient for scarpetta. Cornwall spends a lot of time with descriptions that don't move the plot forward. everything too easy for scarpetta
      Only read the first story didn't old much interest. I thought the book was a full novel with a bonus book at the end. I was disappointed to find that was not the case. I thought the story was too rushed might have been better it the story had been longer. I enjoy reads were I feel like I can amer...

However, it strings you along to a predictably...
      fast paced and exciting magic fun times. i made noises. intrigued about where this story is going. to the sequel!
      This is the first graphic novel I have ever read, and I would never have picked it up if it weren’t for the #VTReadingChallenge, in which “a graphic novel” is one of the categories. I stood, hesitatingly, in front of the shelves of adult graphic novels at my library. Everything looked strange, an...
      Decent romance
      Most of this seemed very obvious to me, but unfortunately it's a much needed message. Well-written, without being negative or judgemental, a good read for parents of pre-schoolers. Skimming is made easy by short and clearly labeled sections.
      Although this is a great book, reading it as a child scared me !!

      Liked the writing and characters of this book, but am never fond of insta love especially when course of book essentially happens over a weekend - I like more of a believeable build up. That aside, strong 3 star read.

      I think I enjoyed this a little more than I really should have.<br /><br />Oh dear.
      "Holly is grieving the loss of her husband. He leaves his wife a gift, which touchingly helps Holly move toward rebuilding a new life. The book could have an obvious ending, thankfully, it does not."
      This was a fun science fiction novel. Think Jack London meets MacGyver set in space. The narrator Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars, and he has to figure out how to survive on the unforgiving planet until he's rescued. Most of the plot is driven by engineering challenges Mark faces. He also ne...
      Not thrilled with the amount of profanity and what I feel was prurient sex. It's an interesting idea and I wouldn't NOT recommend it. Just give some caveats.
      <strong>Uh huh...</strong><br /><br />This was a (very) short erotic interlude between a husband and wife who are trying to put some spice back into their sex lives. It was an okay read.
      <strong>Okay</strong><br /><br />This was an okay story; although not my favorite. I enjoyed the creatures, though. I felt they were very original. The story itself was quite original, as well, though I felt it lacked the proper pizzazz needed to make it great. All in all, a decent effort.
      It was a good start, but a bit choppy as everyone was introduced. I'll keep reading in trade, as the art is excellent.
      Meh, it was okay.

      There is a ghost but that's just peripheral. The real heat is between Jade and Kane.
      The story seemed rather episodic, with some kind of "big bad" plot hinted at in the background. Even though the main character struggled with a serious health problem, the resolution wasn't very interesting. The ending, when the "big bad" finally interacted with the rest of the characters, made u...
      The story really picked up towards the end but overall this was not my favourite of the series. I'm torn because I really feel like the books are becoming ridiculous, but I really love the characters and look forward to reading more about them. Hopefully the next book is better.
      Charming read about an elderly man dealing with his wife's death starting on the first anniversary, when he discovers a charm bracelet he didn't know she had. He begins a search to find out about he charms, and about this side of his wife's life that he knew nothing about.
      A bit strange pacing-wise. I was enjoying the were war and I love the Alcide character but that plotline was over way too quickly only to be replaced by the way less interesting (and also tied up too soon) vamp stand-off. Still, I really enjoy these books and can easily while away an entire after...

      Police drama/thriller. It was a good story. The writing was a bit redundant and annoying at times.
      Kind of slow, like the other books.
      I liked the last book in the trilogy the least as it felt like pages and pages could have been taken out just re-stating what had happened in the last books. I ended up skipping junks of the chapters because of it.
      The book was pretty boring at first, but then the end came along and it made the slow start worthwhile.
      I enjoyed the first two-thirds of the book but it was downhill after that.
      <strong>Realistic story Line</strong><br /><br />It took a long time to catch my interest. I enjoyed the glimpse into New York City terror realities and dangers.
      This one was pretty good. Still really short and not a whole lot of story. But for a short story it hit the mark.

      "The Shattered Crown” by J.W. Webb was an entertaining tale that I read in just a few evenings. It delivers on so many levels, but the most important one to me personally was that it was fun.

      This was a bit of a morality tale. It was ok but not the best I've ever read. I did enjoy the art work though.
      This series started out as a decent escapist sort of fiction, within an interesting and creative world. I may just really be too old to appreciate this one- I found it boring.
      <strong>Formatting problem</strong><br /><br />Every chapter the first page is missing or cut short off the top. I figured it out by adjusting the size of the font.

      <strong>Nice reading</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed reading 2 books in this series. It was page turner from beginning to end. I will be reading more from this author. Excellent writing Christine!!<br />
      Decent writing and a good story, but I must admit that I got some of the characters mixed up - they weren't developed enough for me to quickly visualize them.
      Thriller Romance...just a fun read
      The second half of this book is a straightforward, comprehensible commentary on the book of Esther (despite the fact that it is more than 1000 years old). Because it is a PhD thesis, it contains a huge amount of background, so most of the first half of the book is only of interest to specialists....
      ok theme...faded at end
      It's an interesting "thriller," but lengthy and fragmented with the past/present and varying narrators. By the end of the story, I was relieved it had ended.
      An interesting book, that I chose off the "new book" shelf, at the library. The book started off a little slowly, but picked up significantly toward the end.

      Loved it (mostly). The story of Felicia Day's quirky, nonconformist upbringing left me laughing and ready to close the book, jump up and do something amazing and unexpected. But by the back half, where we get caught up in Felicia's Hollywood world of meetings and marketing, I felt less like I cou...
      An easy read - finished it in an afternoon for our school's Battle of the Books tournament. I did like how the kids got involved in the publishing process. Kind of cool. I wish that Andrew Clements would write "The Cheater" now, with the pseudonym Cassandra Day. That would be awesome.
      Couldn't finish it. Very slow and boring.
      Very refreshing to read something written long before we all became so politically correct. Some good ideas to try to fall asleep more quickly without resorting to pills.
      <strong>Ok for a quick read.</strong><br /><br />Honestly there's nothing to really sink your teeth into. Yes, we learn more about Jenna and Melissa. I wonder if an intelligent woman would be so quick to dismiss the questionable relationship between Jenna and Stephanie. It left me saying: REALLY?
       I have to say that Bend Me, Break Me was a good book, but I just couldn't get into it the way I wanted to. So going into this book, I definitely had no idea exactly what the book was about because the blurb was pretty vague. I really like going into books when the blurb is vague because it reall...
      Got this as a free ARC from Netgalley. This was my first time reading about asexuals. Found it interesting.

      This deserves more than 3 stars, so I say 3.5. It was an interesting read, definitely a deep space scifi. There were a few boring, long and confusing parts, and some characters weren't very relatable, but I think all in all I like it. I'll read the next book in a month after I have a break from t...
      While an interesting premise, I didn’t enjoy the writer’s writing style (personal preference) and, therefore, did not enjoy the book. In addition, I found it distracting when the words broke across lines.
      Waited for years and years for this book. And I had to high expectations. It was a let down. :(
      I liked the tormented part that our hero played. You could feel his emotions given, but I think it got lost on our heroine. You never really get what she looks like? You get hair color but "body type" is not really there. Not bad otherwise and very few, if any typos
