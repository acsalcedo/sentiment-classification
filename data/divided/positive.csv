      ***** ANOTHER WINNER!<br /><br />The fourth book in the Rolling Thunder Series, “Gunnin’ For You,” starts out with a bang––sexually, and as it turns out, metaphorically as well.

I read these when I was growing up and even now, reading it as someone who's almost 25, the world and the ideas floating around in the background are really fantastic.

      This book is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The author's rich descriptions are so wonderful, I had to read them twice.

      I didn't like the Harry Potter books (that is, the ones I managed to finish) so this book by J. K. Rowling really surprised me.

      I really liked this but did initially find it hard to keep up with all of the different characters. As you grow to know them more I found this improved but there would often be long gaps without hearing about certain characters. That said, I'm planning on reading the rest of the series.
