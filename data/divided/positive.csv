      ***** ANOTHER WINNER!<br /><br />The fourth book in the Rolling Thunder Series, “Gunnin’ For You,” starts out with a bang––sexually, and as it turns out, metaphorically as well.

      Lake of Dreams by Linda Howard is a scary at times, suspenseful, and passionate read.

      Once I remembered that Fannie Flagg's books are more like a series of connected short stories, I enjoyed this much more.

      The title of the book gives away the tragedy that happens in the first chapter, a tragedy that, in most other books, would usually be left until at least some of the characters and back story were known.

      <strong>Awesome start</strong><br /><br />This is an awesome start for a series. It is sweet. I also like the development of the characters.

      <strong>Four stars</strong><br /><br />There is not a lot you can say about After Anna without giving anything away. An interesting premise is the centerpiece of this well written novel. My only problem is there isn't a single truly likeable character to be found. Enjoy.",positive

      This was a short story but it had a lot in it. It was well written and fun to read. I actually want to read more about Rhianna and her family.",positive

      From the prologue to the past page, I found myself smiling continually at the very witty Miss Wrong and Mr Right. Robert Bryndza brings a wonderful turn of phrase to some of this characters, and Natalie's Hungarian gran is a real tonic, and one of my favourite characters. <br /><br />Natalie's gran, is writt...",positive

      4. 5 Stars<br /><br />I can't believe its been under a year since I was first introduced to Polwenna Bay, and now this is book 4, and the series shows no signs of slowing down, in fact I'd argue it keeps improving, with each book having a completely different theme to it, as well as a different member of the...",positive

      BUY ME 1<br /><br />Wow....This was my first menage by this author. And I loved it.<br /><br />It was perfect. And hot. Alphas as always obsessively stalkerish. But that's one of the reasons why I'm coming back for more.<br /><br />Another reason is, I'm always drawn into the stories fast. There’s not time to be bored. The storylin...",positive
