      Los Hollister es la serie de libros que me inició definitivamente en la lectura. Recuerdo haber leído el primero y, con todo el dinero que había ahorrado por mi primera comunión y en todos los años anteriores, ir a por los 32 restantes, que costaban 600 pelas cada uno. Los compré todos en la feri...
      Alexandre Dumas avait pour but en écrivant “La San Felice” de démontrer pourquoi on peut pas imposer la démocratie militairement. Dans le troisième tome, Dumas explique finallement sa logique. D'après Dumas les gens qui vivent sous un régime tyrannique désirent l'indépendance (les moyens de faire...
      Excellent book! <br />
      This is a very well written account of a highly complex episode of diplomacy.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the read. The writer has done an excellent job in explicating all the threads of this entangled history. He did this by taking each thread, each piece of the jigsaw and painting the picture in imagin...

      Oh my goodness, what can I say about this book? I'm not sure if I can come up with the adequate words to describe my feelings on this book. I first want to say this was actually my very first book I have read of Mrs. Faiman's. I have helped out on some book releases on my blog, but have yet to ac...
      Well written. Such an unimaginable thing for this family, no more of a review to include.
      Much has been written about how Stephen King’s mind works. From multi-generational horror of It, to the locked-up ghosts of eternity of Doctor Sleep, to the alcoholic isolation of The Shining, King writes monsters as terrifying as anyone. What King does better, as these novels also show, is peopl...
      This book is quietly powerful. In parts I found it even boring. Only nearing the end did I begin to realize all that is left unsaid. In fact I started over again immediately upon finishing.
      we need more about Conrad!!!!!
      This is a great book if you want to find out about what enlightenment is.<br />It is not a how to book, but more a description of the enlightenment experience.<br />He covers it from a lot of different angles: it is the same thing but here described from the point of view of Awareness and there from the poin...
      Used this as a research text and fell right into the dynamic and engaging narrative. A must-read!!!
      While sitting on my own coffee shop promenade, I began to read Vince Guaglione’s most recent work in hopes of finding inspiration towards a new and creative means of self-expression. <br /><br />Consistent with his previous publications, the author continues speaking casually to the reader and is honest abou...
      <strong>Great read. </strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed this story. Great Time travel romances are a hard to find, but this one does not disappoint. It had everything in it that makes it enjoyable from beginning to end. <br />Now I only wonder what the real Elisa is doing in the future.
      Educating yourself and acquiring knowledge is important. This novella is a fine example of how powerful language can be, and how ignorant people can be easily manipulated by twisting words.<br /><br />Eric Arthur Blair A.K.A.

      One word: "Epic"
      <strong>Intriguing</strong><br /><br />I liked Layne almost immediately she is strength and calm. Layne and Beau are pretty amazing as the story unfolds. We see things that remained hidden until the end. I liked the emotions pouring from the pages. I'm a little disappointed by the branch off because it seems more detail was...
      Love this book. Enjoyed it.
      Love, love, loved this book. A refreshing read.
      It's not often that an author can completely surprise me with an ending. Sanderson did.
      A cure fast short for fans of Every Day
      A -M-A-Z-I-N-G !! i cant wait until i can read the second book in this series
      This is an excellent start to an interesting series. The world in which the main characters live is really interesting. It's a little bit of hunger games, some strategy and some intrigue.

      supercute
      This was so charming! It really read like a silent film or a noir film come to life. Love the artwork and the way Phelan worked with the time period and the source material.<br /><br />I'll be interested to see what the finished version looks like as well.
      Kept me on the edge of my seat!!!
      Wow, this story keeps getting better and better. Nala and Vincent have some trust built between themselves now that they've opened up to each other. The danger is increasing though and neither one wants to sacrifice their own justice for the greater good. The stakes are higher and people are gett...
      I am in a terrible reading slump and I picked this up to have a quick, satisfying read. Saga never disappoints.
      Eve Hietamiehestä taisi tulla uusi suosikkikirjailija. Aivan loistava teos, hauska, riipaiseva, todella hyvä tempo. Ainoa mitä pidin epäuskottavana, oli jo liikkuvan lapsen istuttaminen sitterissä. En ole eläissäni kuullut yhdestäkään muksusta joka suostuisi istumaan sitterissä katsomassa vaikkap...
      Science, magic, technology, British folklore, conspiracies, and futurism. In other words, classic Ellis. Add in Shalvey's artwork—which is beautiful and/or horrific as the script demands—and you've got an intriguing start to a new series. I'm looking forward to volume two.
      This book just ugh &lt;3 <br />I love Ritsu and Takano, and this book is introducing Kisa and Yukine who I adore. This whole series is amazing :3
      <strong>Could not put it down!</strong><br /><br />Took me a few chapters to get into the book but then I was hooked. Read it over 24 hours whilst recovering from a virus - great medicine.
      Great little read, a lot like the series town of pearl.
      I thoroughly enjoyed Cripple Creek, a slim novel based on an even slimmer premise. A man is stopped for speeding in the small town of Cripple Creek and is locked up for the night when he reacts violently. A search of his car reveals $200 000 in a bag but not much else. The next day the man is for...
      Great beach read!
      Another great read by Chris Bohjalian! Very timely topic! I could not put the book down.
      Quick read. Can't put it down, had to read all of it until I put it down.
      A pretty simplified story, but a another great read by J.A. Jance.
      It has been a long time since I have read R.L. Stine's novels. So, when I saw an opportunity to read this one I grabbed it. I wasn't disappointed that I did. R.L. Stine has always been known for writing the most fearful edge of your seat novels. I loved his books for kids and I surely fell in lov...
      If you can't get enough of antique pulp fiction heroes like THE SHADOW or THE GREEN HORNET, then buckle up for similar tales of rock 'em-sock 'em, save humanity at every turn adventure from "Secret Agent X".<br /><br />Dubbed "The Man of a Thousand Faces," we never see the real face of this circa 1930's Amer...
      Classic.
      <strong>Heartbreaking true story</strong><br /><br />A young couple fall in love and marry in Australia at the end of the second world war. Within ten years they have four children but only one is healthy. Despite numerous tests no doctors can tell them what is wrong. Extremely moving story terribly sad
      Втората трилогия започва значително по-добре от първата. Към мрачния елф Дризд ДоУорден се присъединяват и варварина Уолфгар, хобитът Риджис и джуджето...еди кой си там (не запомних името).<br />Книжката е забавна, има и хумор, и битки и приключения - какво повече можеш да искаш от несериозно фентъзи?
      <strong>The Last Illusion </strong><br /><br />A wonderful Molly Murphy mystery. Bowen outdid herself on this one. The note at the end of the book reinforced my thoughts as I read that this story was based on some true facts. You will love this book.<br /><br />

      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I just love his books about Stone Barrington. The characters are wonderful and Dino and Viv are great friends. Thank you for such great books Stuart Woods.
      Once I remembered that Fannie Flagg's books are more like a series of connected short stories, I enjoyed this much more. This book is a more cohesive story than some of the others, but some of the chapters seem to have no point other than to be glimpses into a particular character's life. I did e...
      <strong>A Romantic novel</strong><br /><br />This is a very romantic novel. It's really breathtaking. I recommend it to everyone who loves romanticism. Two thumbs up!
      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />An entertaining insiders look at African tourist camps. This couple had experiences with staff, wild animals, and the bosses family border on the unbelievable.
      I’m not sure how much I can say about this book without ruining it for everyone. It is not my intention to reveal any spoilers or expose any secrets so bear with me as I try to review it without giving anything away. Harry Potter and friends are back for their sixth year at Hogwarts. All of our f...
      The title of the book gives away the tragedy that happens in the first chapter, a tragedy that, in most other books, would usually be left until at least some of the characters and back story were known. Then the story moves back in time before the tragic event and then after it with each chapter...
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />I liked this book as much as Mama Does Time. I am again looking forward to the southern antics of mama the three sisters.
      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I just started this series and I can hardly wait to read the rest of the books. Hope everyone else enjoys them as much as l have so far.
      <strong>Makes perfect sense!</strong><br /><br />An amazing read I will never look at food the same in the best possible way. I can not wait to adapt to a new lifestyle. Thank you!!<br /><br />
      A very concise and straightforward guide to meditation. At time it even seems overly simple - but it is an excellent reminder of how not to overdo it when trying to meditate.<br /><br />Its use of mantra meditation helps keep things simple and straightforward. It gets a touch new-agey towards the end, but ov...
      Amazing one<br />
      I DARE you to read this book and not laugh out loud. Artie is my hero and a great role model for people, young and old.
      exceptional book
      No balls, no babies.
      جميل
      Not as good, or at least different, type of plot than the first 3 books. And a totally different style too, but still interesting and great Baldacci writing.
      <strong>Catalyst...</strong><br /><br />As with the previous 2 books, this is an exciting espionage series. The author obviously tales the time to research the more technical descriptions of things giving you a real sense of understanding as to what is happening and it's importance to the story. Can't wait for the next book....
      $v
      Fantastic read! Can not wait for book #2!
      <strong>Much better than expected</strong><br /><br />White following the basic romance formula, this piece is very well written with good characters and plot twists that keep the reader engaged. I look forward to the next installment.
      <strong>Great story and interesting sub narratives </strong><br /><br />Great story and interesting sub narrative. Really helps you experience the time and how America allowed for the rise of Hitler.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />Really enjoyed the book. Can't wait for the next one to be published. Will read her other books for now
      I freely admit, I had to read this one with the lights on...in every room in my flat or in broad daylight. Yes, I'm a fraidy cat and there isn't one Stephen King book in my extensive collection because I am a fradiy cat. That being said, I can't pass on any Lexxie Couper book; so the lights were...

      Year of Ravens is a unique look at Boudica's rebellion against Rome. Seven different authors have told the story through seven different lenses, so you get the grit of battle from the perspective of a Roman warrior, the magic of the isle of Mona as told by a young druid, and the aftermath of the...
      I really enjoyed reading “Simon” by Michael Mullin I thought it was excellently written with very clean editing (I notice things like that!) and kept my attention from the dramatic opening to the bittersweet end. I read it relatively quickly and loved the characters and the fresh twist that the a...
      It's a toga dropper!<br />Arthur Griffin’s, “The Lusty Adventures of Theseus”, is exactly what the author promises. This retelling of the Theseus myth casts the ancient Greek bastard prince as a wayward lad in search of himself. Theseus personal growth is aided with the help of lusty, worldly Pirithuou...
      Desperately Seeking Epic……. I’m desperately seeking another box of tissues and a glass of wine! This isn’t my first book with BN Toler. In fact, Where One Goes is one of my all time favorites so had high expectations going into this and she most definitely didn’t disappoint me. <br /><br />Neena is 12-year-o...
      <strong>Interesting</strong><br /><br />Enough but lagged in the end. Too much about the court scenes and not enough real meat to the story. I don't like being left hanging at the end,so will not bother with any more of the series.
      Such an amazing book, I was wanting to reread it a month after i finished it
      Not a huge fan of graphic novels but this was laugh out loud funny.
      Loved it
      My Thoughts<br /><br />I watched The Bachelor and The Bachelorette when Emily was on and I remember her being my favorite. I was pulling for her and hoping she would find love both times and was sad when things didn’t work out for her. So, when I saw this book I was so excited to read and review it!<br /><br />I wasn’t...
      Absolutely fantastic narration elevates this thriller into a good solid 4.5 star listen. The story itself is perhaps your standard thriller fare (decently written but nothing to shout from the rooftops about), but it's worth the listen if you like audiobooks. Really well done.
      Best bio I have read in a while. Loved it! Can't imagine living a life so full. And... It's a great love story.
      Taylor Boothe 8-Red pg240 Book Review 7<br /><br />"The story of my life" was one of the most inspiring things you will ever read. "The Story of my Life" is an autobiography by Helen Keller. It's always interesting to see what goes on in someone's life and their point of view. I also loved the way she uses a...
      Intense.
      new babes<br />
      Beautiful. Broken. Heart-wrenching. And ultimately, Hopeful.
      A Splendor of Letters is an informative, entertaining and ultimately downright inspiring paean to books. Four stars Not the least of the book's merits is that it's like a friend telling you about stuff you'll want to read about- see The Club Dumas, my next read.
      Insightful and actionable. Not entirely new information but good to hear it again.
      Steve Martin is one intense guy.
      <strong>Unputdownable</strong><br /><br />A very enjoyable read, an old story made believable. Each character came to life . once again Nora Lofts proved her gift.
      great book. I used to live in the area for a few years and reading this book reminded me of the great things in the area.
      Loved Rosemarie's voice. A very worthy read-- from the author who was front center at George Magazine &amp; the assistant to John Kennedy Jr. Heartfelt, honest,--funny and heartbreaking-- One could relate to having work days named "opposite day" &amp; "because I said so" day; ---the boss is not p...
      <strong>Great job!</strong><br /><br />I gave 5 stars because I couldn't put it down. I like the characters especially Conrad. I'm a big fan of the author and love her style.
      <strong>I laughed so hard I cried!</strong><br /><br />OMG!!! This book is exactly what I needed! It was hilarious, light hearted and much fun to read! Olivia and Oren make such an awesome couple! I love the relationship Olivia has with her dad and her bff Scout!!!! Five stars for sure
      <strong>Reminiscent of "Room"</strong><br /><br />A dysfunctional family and their mysteries, explored by an 11-year-old boy who loves them fiercely yet suspects there's a dark background to his family's life in the basement. Bizarre, complex characterizations and a surprising plot. A worthwhile read.
      Full of laugh out loud and swoon worthy moments. I absolutely loved Matt! Such a manwhore but commits when he knows what he wants. You don't have to read the Bliss series to read this book but if you're like me and love to know the other characters' stories, I would recommend reading those first....
      Only one word: <br />AMAZING!!!!!!!
      I loved it from the beginning to the end. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. The things that Rose discovers about herself and what she can enjoy living with Mr. Greenwood, Kathy and Sam is very intriguing. Will she learn to like the life style and be able to join or share in the fu...

      2 book of this series.. and definely not a dissapointment at all. Really first time that I read about the dragons as I really am not into them but this just made me realize how many books are out there that I completely disregarded since I never wanted to read about a dragon shifter. <br /><br />
      I was touched by the insight author Barbara Rainey shared in Letters to My Daughters: The Art of Being a Wife. While frequently marriage books give lists of specific ways to make changes, Rainey focuses on the big picture and where we want to go in our marriages. Rainey thoughtfully shares her li...
      I really am looking forward to this series.... <br /><br />This book was really good and I really loved the whole PNR as I am a big fan. so this was up my alley.
      <strong>Love Sexy Sawyer</strong><br /><br />I just finished reading Sweet Love and it was amazing. I love Sawyer and his sexy mouth! Th way he loves Grace and their family is fierce just like him. Parker is exactly like his dad! I'm sure his book will be as entertaining as Sawyers. I don't even know what to say about that l...

      <strong>Who proofread this book?</strong><br /><br />The story was good but if I hadn't known slang I couldn't have finished it. Terrible spelling. Someone needs to do better.

      This was a masterful read, with more than one significant plotline, challenging and entertaining. Recommendable.
      “So strange is the contact of one with another.”<br /><br />I expect to re-read “The Waves” (1931), in part because its (Modernist) difficulty is likely to release new meanings, rather than confirm assumptions or provide reassurance, but also because as its six characters get older and, in their interspersed...
      Very basic, but a good summary of many aspects of politics
      Read it for school, looking forward to talking about it with some of the older students.
      One of my favorite comprehensive vegetarian cookbooks.
      The incredible story of this curious traveler coming from Grenada who was captured by Pirates and sold to the Pope became his geographer.
      This was on the reading list for the history part of my German Studies degree. Quite an eye opener and written in a way laymen like myself could appreciate.

      Excellent, excellent novel! Very enjoyable and hard to put down.
      This book was fantastic. I really thought she was becoming crazy.
      I loved this book so much! it was heavy in ots content and made me feel the panic and sorrow on the protagonist and all the kids in the panopticon. However, it was readable and I skimmed through it easily. I loved this book so much.
      <strong>I really enjoyed this book</strong><br /><br />So I started reading this on a whim, got into the book very easily and enjoyed the story very much.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />This book was hard to put down with so many twists and turns. I'm usually able to figure out who the villain is early on in a book but not this one. Really enjoyed it.

      <strong>Great story</strong><br /><br />I was quickly caught up in the atmosphere of this story and wanted to keep reading until it was finished. The tense it is written in seemed unusual but possibly that contributed to the drama. I enjoyed the juxtaposition of past and present, and the ideas around the interconnectedness o...
      <strong>Very good book</strong><br /><br />Great edge of your seat reading. Very well written. Also very informative as to the ploys of politics. I could not put it down.
      Bloody brilliant! Perfect short read - sweet, sexy, hilarious - perfect rom com! I thoroughly recommend
      4.5 stars<br /><br /><br /><br />I loved this book, however it was very very very sad. which I heard about before picking this book up but it did break my heart. I enjoyed it up until the ending.
      Splendidly captivating! I couldn't stop reading; I just wanted it to go on and on and on. I really enjoyed the two story lines switching between the past and present. The plot is excellent and maintains a solid detective with a highly intelligent and intricate plot. The authors have tempered that...

      To see this on stage is now a new goal of mine. A perfect read that can sum up that feeling in life where you wonder are you proud of what you achieved and has it brought you happiness. As someone who once did door to door marketing, failing, dreaming, and hoping - I can empathize with this novel...
      Such an inspirational story about a lady named Martha Mason who spent most of her life in an iron lung because of polio. Her family and community offered amazing support. Extremely well written.
      An all-round fabulous read with beautifully rounded characters, a distressing but perfectly pitched back-story, and a brilliantly crafted plot that keeps you guessing to the eminently satisfying conclusion. I became so infatuated with this page-turner that the characters even penetrated my dreams...

      These books keep me on edge. I love that River got her happy ever after. I hope this series continues for a long time. I really love these books

      I'm not known for crying, but this book made me sob like a little baby. Never done that before.
      Interesting from start to finish. I loved the adventure and the time traveling and the characters as well. I especially loved Nixie's relationship with her father. Once I got half way through the book I had to finish it. I needed to know what would happen. <br /><br />Overall it was a really good read.
      Every so often a book comes around and heals your soul from wounds you didn't even know you had.
      Wonderful book!!!! <br /><br />Full review coming soon.

      Loved it. Was a great follow up book from Crazy Rich Asians and cannot wait to see what Kevin Kwan comes up with next.
      We are really enjoying this series.
      <strong>So good</strong><br /><br />Could not put it down -- well written -- good twists and turns -- and very entertaining :) :) ;)
      Delightful character study. Oddly a charming love story filled with suspense and a bit of gore. Hoping for a sequel.
      wow! this was hot! was not expecting the ending. it will be interesting to see how this series ends.
      <strong>Wow!!! Another grand slam with Alex Cross. A novel that will keep you up all night. </strong><br /><br />A thriller that only Patterson can develop in his distinctive fashion. Enjoyed every page; can't wait for the next thriller.
      One of those rare books where, as I'm reading it, I keep thinking of more and more and more people I want to give it to!

      <strong>Great read</strong><br /><br />What a great read! I couldn't put it down and the ending was more than I expected. I will recommend to all my friends.
      <strong>Good read, nice storyline</strong><br /><br />This was a sweet, passionate love story with characters that really came to life. I don't usually read fiction, let alone romance novels, but I must say that this book has opened the door to the genre for me. The book was a gift that I'm happy to have received.
      <strong>Three World Connect</strong><br /><br />The past, the future, and a fantasy world. Pears combines science fiction and fantasy to ruminate on the meaning of time and the stories we tell and how they affect our lives, while weaving a story that never flags.
      Nice version of the Princess and the Pea. It keeps the humor, while being more realistic. Violet and Richard are a good couple.
      <strong>Great job</strong><br /><br />Loved this book, one of the best in the dark series. Ready for the next book and poor Gary, his story has to be awesome!
      We love fractured fairy tales!
      Magical. Didn't want it to end.
      Loved this book. Ackerman's writing is so rich and beautiful--but also packed with information and provocative food for thought.
      I enjoyed the relationships built in this book.

      <strong>Nova Nova Nova</strong><br /><br />This is one grimey trick! I mean she did some shady crap from jumped, but what do expect from a true paper chasing ride or die trick! Get your because she is sure gonna get hers! Lol!
      <strong>Who done it?</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed reading this. Snappy patter and quick wits can get you out of anything, including ghostly revenge apparently. Should lead to some interesting sequels.
      A fun, fluffy sci-fi with serious writing but a chaotic and fun plot. Passed along for others to enjoy.
      I like tilly the best
      Esta historia me sorprendió para bien, al principio estaba un poco cuestionándome si leerlo o no, por si me encontraba la misma historia de siempre, pero finalmente me decidí y para mi sorpresa me encontré algo distinto.<br />Una historia que engancha desde el principio, muy rápida de leer, donde no pa...

      This is a charming series, set in Northern Ireland in the 1960s. It reminds me of the All Creatures series. The audio version makes a great driving companion.
      A funny heroine and a cocky hero are the perfect recipe for a wonderful novel.<br /><br />Sadie is witty and strong willed, West is cocky, and at times just drove me crazy with his aloofness. Their scenes were steamy, dramatic and completely captured my attention. The story is full of great secondary charact...
      Delightfully charming and a glimpse into a world traversed by so few in the writing world. I found it quite enjoyable in so many ways. The plot was intriguing and mysterious, the characters uniquely fun, and the main character Charlotte a bundle of laughs as she tries to learn about proper ettiqu...
      When I started the book, I was confused because it started out in a way that made me think it was a nonfiction self-help marriage relationship book. Once it started with the chapters, I quickly became engrossed and couldn't stop. I really liked the way each point of view was separated by headings...
      This was a pretty cool series. Different take on the whole genre. A lot of DNA science stuff but also enough tension to keep ti entertaining.
      I love a good gothic mystery and this book definitely delivered in that area. The structure was a bit odd, what with it starting on one characters then flipping over to a whole set of other characters, but I was totally invested in the mystery of Wraxford Manor until the bitter end (which was a l...

      <strong>Deliver me from evil</strong><br /><br />This was a very disturbing book. I find it hard to fathom how anybody could be so mean and abusive to these children and nobody noticed anything going on. How sad is that. My heart goes out to all the children in Eunice's care. I don't think she got enough punishmentfor what s...
      <strong>American Hero</strong><br /><br />Definitive history of one of America's heroes sadly lost too soon. The basis for the recent film, the book adds the intimate and personal highs and lows, wins and losses, smiles and tears of an American patriot and his family and nation.
      I love this book. It's really good.

      Hanging out with Elizabeth Gilbert's mind is a treat. When she's writing about the creative process--even better.
      I thought it was a very interesting book. I enjoy reading books about Louisiana. If you enjoy reading books about our Southern States, please read!
      Vlot geschreven. Boeiend door de verschillende verhaallijnen
      <strong>Great Read!!!</strong><br /><br />I really liked this book. It was a funny yet serious thriller. It was a page turner with a surprise ending.
      <strong>Quite entertaining!</strong><br /><br />Loved that the author did some historical homework before putting the plot on paper. I learned some things. This is fast paced and the story drew me in quite easily, I couldn't put it down.

      I enjoyed this book. No! it was not comparable to Gone Girl however, it definitely had its cray cray factor. I could have passed on the lengthy background of Jodi's childhood abuse. I felt that the villain got what he deserved in the end.
      I thought the cover was rather fantastic and this was further emphasized when I read the story. The story also appealed very much to me as an older reader as it further emphasized the point that it is never too late to re-start your life (especially to uproot yourself) into completely new surroun...
      it was amazing,The best book I ever read ,I adore it <br />Gill Lewis is the best
      4.5 stars!!
      Good book. The story line was good. Kept turning the pages to find out who destroyed Ryley's &amp; Evan's future together. My heart was hurting a little bit more for Evan as the days go by where Ryley didn't give neither of them an answer.
      A fine story of struggle and family and forgiveness
      Perfect book for early twenties. The characters are vivid and real. This book portraits the tough life but still let readers believe in the core part of our souls.

The story is captivating, the scenery breathtaking, and the characters believable. Truly a ground breaking classic, which should be read now and for years...
      I finally finished this fascinating book. I can see what Lin-Manuel Miranda saw in it. It's one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read.
      <strong>Shaw is the proverbial "sick puppy" ...</strong><br /><br />... And that's why we keep coming back for more! Who says Christmas and horror don't go together? Certainly NOT Matt Shaw! For all the people who don't pass up good horror any day of the year ... Get your copy! And do not wait until next Christmas!
      This was a book that kept you wondering. I felt that the author did a great job at keeping you interested.
      The plot continues to move at a fairly slow pace but the artwork is unbelievable, some really great and effective panels. There's a nice twist at the end that drums up some excitement for the next issue.
      This is really a great early chapter book, which has font that is similar to an easy reader, so kids won't be so intimidated by its length. It's not only about basketball, but learning new skills and learning how to work together with your friends/family. I would definitely give this to reluctant...

      The New Bern beachhead established in 1862 in North Carolina is a subject rarely visited by Civil War historians, even though the fighting in this colorful “war within a war” saw all sorts of curious incidents and raids.

      Almost my favorite one of the Harry Potter series, it is so suspenseful. I love at the end when Sirus fights his sister and the brains that take the bad guy's brain.<br />

      ‘The Elephant in the Dark’ is as vital now as it was when first published in 1974. In it Shah shows us that deep understanding is possible between Muslims and Christians. It is achieved, not through discussion and preaching, but by living lives that have been touched by God, and changed. He gives...
      This book is incredibly dark when compared with Year One- both the story and the artwork. Great story and the length meant that you could relate to and understand the characters a lot more. The shocker of an ending is so unexpected and just leaves you wanting more!
      Everything Falls Apart<br /><br />Everything starts to fall apart in 1986. Mandy is raising three children on her own, sixteen-year-old twins Mark and Jenny, and eleven-year-old Jakey.

      While I understand that the walk around London was an idea of how to link all of the different parts of the book together I don't really think it worked for me. <br />It's clear to see from this book that, to me at least, David Mitchell has lead a very interesting life so far. Also it's lovely to read...
      Fun characters and good premise. An enjoyable read.
      If you’re a fan of historical fiction, this book is definitely a must-read! I always find this period of time fascinating myself, I always appreciate well-researched books about WWII, and “Lebensborn” certainly didn’t disappoint. <br />It tells a story of a young French girl in one of the occupied vill...
      My daughter and I loved this book. It was such a joy to read it together with her.

      My favourite of the three Batman novels I've read so far. This book manages to pack so many twists and turns into the plotline- the origin of Batman's sidekick, some of Catwoman's mysterious history and you are introduced to Mr. Freeze. The artwork in this is incredible and so colourful! Definite...
      I've never read any of Iain Banks' books before and I will definitely be reading more now. I genuinely don't understand the three-star reviews I've seen on Shelfari and Amazon. Sometimes you come across a book that really stays with you for a long time, for me this will be one of those books. The...
      I was surprised that reading this I began to sympathise with the Joker and how he came to be as crazy as he is. The art-work in this is stunning and I have nothing but praise for it, it's a lot more realistic than in other graphic novels I've read. The plot is quite creepy though and I anticipate...
      I loved this story. I wanted to come through the book and have words with the son, but I loved the couple. Highly recommend.
      Una de las primeras apariciones en del rey Arturo en la historia. Totalmente sin desperdicio.
      Very fun and enjoyable book and I was very pleased!
      I thought this one was really fun and creative. My 3.5 year old loved it.

They both have had things in their past to happen for them to guard their hearts close. Will they be able to open up enough to...
      This is not a textbook, but it is packed with so much knowledge and so many experiences pulled from real life organizations, you will learn as much about performance management as if you had attended class.

      One of the most outstanding features of any of Terry Tyler’s books is her ability to create rounded characters that come alive the first time they open their mouths. <br />Best Seller, a Tale of Three Writers, is no exception. And the reader is also allowed to observe the inner dialogue, the immediate...
      Some very interesting ideas in this book. I picked it up because the title was compelling. We've all thought about what we'd say to our younger self, if we had the chance. What would change in our lives if we could do that? I've also wondered what my dreams meant. This story brings the 2 together...
      Ngalir, keren, menegngkan dan karakternya bikin saya keki
      I'm super unsure about my rating ... mostly because I had absolutely no expectations for this book and not even an idea what it really is about. However, I enjoyed it a lot!<br /><br />I mean, it's pretty graphic, a little weird but also extremely cool! More than excited for the next volume! :D
      A quick, surprisingly enjoyable read. It's an imaginative take on the world of vampires with a heroine who is realistic and a good role models for girls.
      I recently reread this for school and I am glad to say it was even better the second time around. (03/24/26)

      My notes say that this book had lovely description. It is a children's book. The movie Secret of Moonacre is based on it.
      LOVED this book. The perfect example of the unreliable narrator takes us through his highly unconventional life as a thief.

      4.5-star read
      Probably my new favorite book.
      <strong>Awesome start</strong><br /><br />This is an awesome start for a series. It is sweet. I also like the development of the characters. Especially the main one, he is very sweet and too smart for his own good. I hope the second book comes out soon. I will be keeping an eye out for it.
      keeps you hooked all the way through and keeps you guessing.
      <strong>Amazing.</strong><br /><br />I'm a die hard Cassandra Clare fan and this may be her best book yet. I can't even express the level of good this thing is.
      Depressing but ultimately uplifting.
      <strong>Four stars</strong><br /><br />There is not a lot you can say about After Anna without giving anything away. An interesting premise is the centerpiece of this well written novel. My only problem is there isn't a single truly likeable character to be found. Enjoy.
      This was a short story but it had a lot in it. It was well written and fun to read. I actually want to read more about Rhianna and her family.

      <strong>Funny and true</strong><br /><br />A lot of the stories in this book are common sense. But there's a light, humorous tone all mothers appreciate because we've all been there.
      Great book. Love Lenora Worth's writing. She's a great story teller, one that you'll fall in love with the characters, well written and fast paced.
      <strong>Loved!</strong><br /><br />I can't wait I read the next part of the story with Colton and Sophie!! Sophie and Colton forever
      4. 5 Stars<br /><br />I can't believe its been under a year since I was first introduced to Polwenna Bay, and now this is book 4, and the series shows no signs of slowing down, in fact I'd argue it keeps improving, with each book having a completely different theme to it, as well as a different member of the...

      My book group read this in February and it was one of the only books on which we all agreed. I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was an interesting premise and although other books have been written about hostage situations, this one wasn't all about shooting things and high action. Instead...
      I do not give five stars easily, but this book deserves twenty-hands down one of my favorites. I read it in two days and actually had to ration it because I didn't want it to end. I spent the last forty pages sobbing and actually had to stop reading at one point because I was crying too much to s...
      What a fabulous radio adaption. One of my favorites. The acting was superb. Highly recommend.

      Ooh I just loved this story. It can be read as a stand alone, as all of the books in this series can. If you haven't read any of the Nocturne Falls series, you are missing out on a real treat!

      Sweeping family drama from the late 1800s—with a moral or two, naturally! Quite enjoyable.
      As with author Pryce’s other romance from Montlake, this is a story filled with witty phrases, sensual descriptions, and characters for whom we hope the best. Though at first the participants may seem stock characters—the mysterious nobleman, the jealous cousin, the woman given to one but wanted...
      This was the first book I’ve read by this author G.A. Beller, but I certainly hope it’s not the last. He has a gift for writing descriptive and life-like scenes that make us feel like we are really there inside the story, as opposed to it all just being rehashed to us and keeping us away from the...
      The truth will set you free<br /><br />Dan and Maddie Hudson are on their honeymoon.<br /><br />Maddie hopes to show Dan there is another side to her but might have risked their marriage when she pushes to far.

      Loved every bit of this.
      clearly a 4 star read, but I'm gonna go ahead and put a 5 on it - so emotional right now.
      It's a really nice book and I can say that I can relate because I suffered from anxiety and I learn new technique ...

      <strong>The best</strong><br /><br />These books are killer...so great you can't put down..now to wait for more of the story. They only get better
      "The Fall” was a very original take on ‘fiction’ for me, and at times it seemed like I was reading a recounting of something “real” that had happened, even though that is obviously not the case. I know that all fiction novels are like that (realistic-feeling stories that are made up), but this on...

      <strong>Couldn't put it down</strong><br /><br />I could not put this book down. It took a bit to get used to the writing style since it is written in a five year old boy's perspective. Great story line and details!
      Excellent and complex journey story.
      Excellent insights!
      <strong>Pure Entertainment!</strong><br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable read! Nothing less should be expected: An undead family ... Krampus ... and authored by Jeff O'Brien. So pick up a copy ... Take a short adventure in your mind and read this story ... nothing can go wrong ...
      So interesting and unique. Not like anything I've read before, but somehow reminiscent of other books that I liked.
      Another in the jeremiad on the consequences of the squeeze on discretionary spending resulting from the Baby Boomer consensus: we will have great entitlements (Social Security and MediCare) for Baby Boomers and the elderly (protected by the Left), we will maintain a strong defense, and we are not...
      Stunning. Read in one session. An experience to repeat - soon!
      Beautiful writing that captures the feeling of exploration and the opportunity of 'just going'. The overall tone is realistic, yet encouraging for women exploring on their own. Great book.
      I received a copy of this book from Netgalley, but that did not influence my review.<br /><br />This book was not entirely new to me as if you spend a lot of time on the internet, you’ve probably seen some of Andersen’s work. However, it’s no less amusing on the second viewing. I imagine this book is relatab...
      I absolutely loved his book. Pam is great at detailing where to visit and why locations on the island are best for different travelers. She makes what would normally be pretty mundane reading funny and I laughed out loud more than once. I can't wait to apply the information in her book to my upco...
      A beautiful picture book with a story I was familiar with--the loving devotion of Hachiko, a dog in Japan who waits for ten years at the railway station hoping for the return of his master who died at work so never came home on the train one day.
      Loved this book, was really intriguing the entire way through. Would definitely recommend for adults interested in mystery/fantasy.
      it's really hard to explain how I felt about this book. It was intense that's for sure, and just over some damn chocolates. but the chocolate wasnt what's important, its the power balance and politics of the school, which I found disgusting yet well developed. I couldn't put the book down, but no...
      Cracking book full of hard facts ... how many planes we lost in france and how many we sent.<br />How badly equipped were we in july 1940 - No vagueness here.<br />Chilling account of how FDR would have let us fight alone but thanks to the only leader stupid enough to declare war on the US we were ok .. up t...
      An enthralling page turner that you cannot put down, but extremely violent.
      i really like this one. especially ultear
      <strong>Another Winner</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It's still Salty. Most of this was already done in the Salty Series. It just gave the missing details of Paris and Hood. I was expecting something different because we already saw how it ends unless this will have a different ending? Well, we have to wait and se...
      <strong>Okay</strong><br /><br />This was slow going but got good near the end. It had some funny lines too. I was trying to figure out where this was going. Lol. I still don't know. But there's something here that makes me want to see what's going to happen. I mean if I had a friend like Armani, I would just cut her off but...
      Dick Meadows has done a wonderful job with sharing his growing up in small town usa. Well written and enjoyable to read. Looking forward to reading more by this author.
      Not nearly as much story here as The Dark Knight Returns, but I enjoyed the more focused look at Batman and Jim Gordon, plus I preferred the art style in this book over TDKR.
      This is one of those books whose every word needs to be savored. Schofield has given thought to the thoughts of “our woman” and carefully crafted them into this book. And in doing so she has given unique insight to the mind and the pains it endures.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/hu9ashu" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/hu9ashu</a>
      I go through this one again every 2-3 months.
      I really enjoyed this book. The series is realy gripping. I thought I had this one figured out but not quite. Looking forward to the next one!
      Smart and funny. I usually have trouble "getting" the humor in books, but this one, told in the dry witty style of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, made me laugh. And Samuel is a great middle-grade character.
      Loved being immersed in this world. Reading this series was great - listening to it on audio afterwards was even more fun. I liked knowing the correct pronunciations. Good orator as well.
      I enjoyed this story and laughed out loud countless times. Julia is a clothing designer who enjoys her work and has numerous models and celebrities as clients. Ben is a client and a drummer in a band. They have an instant connection that is both exciting and terrifying. <br /><br />I received a free copy in...
      worth reading the first one to really follow this one, which is thematically and stylistically superior in almost every way. very enjoyable.
      <strong>Good mystery</strong><br /><br />Very good book and holds your interest, many interesting twists and turns. A very good who done it. I really enjoyed this book.

      To me this seemed like a cross between Lord of the Flies and The Hunger Games- funnily enough having enjoyed both of those I did really enjoy this as well. I was also intrigued to realise an Amazon reviewer also commented on this as well. The plot is original and gripping, the characters- while m...
      I enjoyed this a lot more than I was anticipating and read it in only a few sittings out on the balcony. It really highlights how strong class divides were at the end of the 1800s and how much sooner children had to grow up then. I found it very easy to sympathise with the main character but also...
      Really good, but can get confusing at parts
      This is a sweet story about love and forgiveness. I love stories that take place during Christmas.
      A great read. Left me in tears but with a satisfying ending.
      Absorbing.
      Everyone would enjoy adding this book to their library.<br />
      This is the seventh in the Institute series by this author, and yet again she does not disappoint. Olivia Rogers has a secret desire to be owned and mastered by a dominant man, but cannot convey these desires to her boyfriend, Jared. Unknown to her, she is being watched by Gabriel, the trainer at...
      Brilliant! The Ladybird generation has grown up.
      This book was almost harder to write than the first. It took me so long to figure out where I wanted to go with this series! However, I think the end product is one fans of the first book will love. Prepare for drama, drama, drama!
      Unlike what the cover suggests I do think that an interest in baseball, or at the very least sports, is essential to enjoy this book. Given the reputation that footballers have in this day and age I'm surprised that this book was seen as controversial when it was published. Even though it made me...
      As this was my first experience of travel writing I didn't know what to expect and was surprised to find I really liked it. It did take me a while to get into it, hence why four stars- but from around 50 pages in it was excellent. The vivid descriptions coupled with his (perhaps unexpectedly) Bri...
      Captivating. The plot is brief and scrolling fast with gathering many details in short form and in fast pace. Not so elaborate or detail oriented script but crisp and quick !!
      The version of Hush I read was in black and white, with some of the panels still a work-in-progress and notes drawn onto them. Only the speech and sounds were in colour. I thought this was very effective and interesting to read although I would like to read the finished full-colour version too. I...
      <strong>A great follow-up to Book 1. Now onto Book 3</strong><br /><br />I've always loved historical fiction and when it encompasses the theme of Christianity and the love of God it makes for an especially inspirational read.
      <strong>A lot of wow moments.</strong><br /><br />This book was well done and my bookclub enjoyed the read. Looking forward to next book and what happens with the family.
      I love ALL of Anne Malcom's books. She's an amazingly talented writer. Check her boys out today, they don't disappoint.

      #2 in the Spenser series.<br /><br />Spenser novel - Spenser meets high school guidance counselor Susan Silverman while searching for a high school boy who may have run away - or was he kidnapped. What place does body builder Vic Harroway and his young followers have in the affair?
      I actually listened to this on Audible. Loved it!!
      <strong>Marvelous series</strong><br /><br />The series just keeps getting better. I like to read books that keep my attention to the last. I think I have the antagonist figured out and then I get thrown for a loop. Excellent series.<br />
      The story takes place in 1840. Milan takes the concept of how a young man expresses his first stirring of sexual attraction: tormenting or teasing the object of affection and turns it into a story with the theme of forgiveness and change.<br />The story has a good lesson about bullying and how both tor...
      Cute!
      I love her books. Once I start them, I can't finish them. I am almost sad that I am finished since her next Maiden Lane book won't be out for another year! What a great story. I love the heroine Artemis (great name). I have enjoyed seeing all of these characters in her previous books. I wonder if...
      <strong>Fairytale Ghost</strong><br /><br />Great romance! Ms . Roberts never fails to entertain with her stories of love. Adding a ghost looking for HER lost love just added more romance to it all!
      What a fun read! I liked all of the characters. Not sure why she had Oriel/Opheliia as split personality. But I liked that it wasn't a typical romance. Will read more in this series.
      <strong>Great end to a great series</strong><br /><br />So many times a series ends with so many things left hanging. This was a nice ending that wrapped it all up. The closure on everyone you meet along the way helps a little in avoiding the inevitable withdrawal when it's all over.
      loved it
      I have found this new author and I like her stories. I enjoyed this book and I hope to read the next book in the series. I did like that the maid was the one threatening Isabella and that she (the maid) happened to be her first husband's mistress.
      Very short story, but a good afternoon read.
      Eileen's story will inspire you to get out of the house and take action--whether it's to combat climate change (her cause) or the cause that most moves you.

However, the elderly couple is a real pain, so no one is too upset when they both die within minutes of each other. The sheriff is sure that one of them was murdered, and since he ha...
      The story is heart rending but what a wonderful ache!
      Probably the only book in the series that is actually good. I'm happy I stuck around with the series, because this one was a treat. The other nine... Not so much. Now on to the 11th!

      Cleverly written and great illustrations. Both my kids and I enjoyed this story.
      Well written and consistently solid, there’s not one story in <em>The Dark at the End of the Tunnel</em> that I wanted to skip over, even the one or two I had read previously in their original releases. It’s not only a delight to reread these stories, it’s great to see how they fit together as part of thi...
      i know i read this...i just don't know where my review went...will add it when i find it.
      I'd describe this as a more realistic/ relatable version of a Nicholas Sparks story. I read this in a three and a half hour sitting as I couldn't put it down.

      I do not often read steampunk but do read a lot of paranormal romance. This one was a bit of both and I absolutely loved it. The characters are well-drawn and the story line sucked me in and pulled me along until the very last word. <br /><br />Miles and Lucy make a great couple. Miles is brooding and solita...

      3/16/16<br />Book Review <br />Sierra Collins<br /><br />Meaningful Curriculum for Young Children by Eva Moravcik <br /><br />Before I begin, this book is nonfiction. I learned multiple things in this book about children and how to handle and deal with different things. I learned that there are all different type of characteristics...
      This is a fantastic, clever, and very complex book! Not to read, but the depths are deep. It's actually two stories after the birthday bunny scribbles out parts and transforms himself and the story into Battle Bunny! Love it!
      The strange, compelling, and very dense nature of Desai's relentless writing is curious. The writing is not labored; its lush. There's not an extraneous word, though there are lots of words. Each sentence propels a thousand thoughts; each thought an image; each image a vision of tradition, aliena...
      All of my favourite characters' narratives are back so I much preferred this to A Feast for Crows. I don't feel like anything has really been resolved in this one so I'm hoping part 2 will do that. Absolutely desperate to see where a few of the individual storylines go now!
      I love Harry Potter!
      <strong>Awwwww</strong><br /><br />True love preserves through it all.. I was so into this book that I read it in about two hours.. The plot had so many twists and turns and the characters were awesome.. Everyone of them was interconnected some kind of way.. Great standalone book!!!!
      <strong>Exciting new spinoff from Grim</strong><br /><br />I loved this book! M.K. Eidem has branched out to introduce another culture connected to the Tornians. I love how she has interwoven the characters from her other books with this one. I can't wait for the next story. Definitely a keeper! I highly recommend this book...
      <strong>A good read</strong><br /><br />Where is part II! This book is the ish. I I've all the characters in this book. I can't wait to see what happens next.
      <br />Loved it! The characters are so well written and thought out. From the first page you feel like part of the story and never want it to end. The whole series is great and this book is no exception.
      Having played the PS4 game first, I was already hooked. I couldn't leave this universe so soon and wow, I am glad I started reading the books. For me, I actually think it's better that I played the last game in the series before going right back to the first book. Somehow it just makes every stor...
      Okay, not as good as the first 3.
      <strong>A another success by Mr. Kane</strong><br /><br />I continually find myself waiting for the next book in the series. What more can I say other than I enjoy Mr. Kane's writing and highly recommend this book.
      Awesome!
      Awesome!
      A disturbing book with an annoying moral dilemma. The protagonist narrator is obviously very ill.... and so is his 'loving' family.
      "And now, the news where you are." So begins the regional news anywhere you go in the UK apart probably from London. And so introduces our main character here, Frank Allcroft, depressingly funny man - you know the kind, tweed jacket, touchy feely (in other words has no sense of boundaries) and th...
      <strong>Love This Series</strong><br /><br />I love this series. Don't know how I missed that the last book came out. The Baby is the perfect ending. The writing remains fantastic and the story is fantastic. I'm just sad that this is the end of Sophie and Neil's story. Hopefully we get more of them in the future. Just be rea...
      Really good series by a contemporary of Agatha Christie! Angela Marchmont is first class.
      Terrific mentor text for breaking the fourth wall. Gives students options in creative writing.
      Light...Childish and chill !!
      Right from the beginning I was hooked. The description and dialogue trapped me within the pages of the story. Erik Sinclair is a cocky, arrogant jerk, which came through perfectly in the beginning. Throughout the story you see behind the mask of a star and let us see who he really is. Ronnie (the...
      There are so many amazing, easy recipes in here - I think I gained weight just reading the book! These girls really know how to add easy panache to celebrations.

      <strong>Very good read.</strong><br /><br />Nice book called t wait for the next one to come out the purple and black Dragon shoe be lyrics .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      This is by far the best book I have ever read. If you dont cry during this book you need to see a doctor.
      <strong>Interesting</strong><br /><br />The storyline was different from any mystery books I've read, I did find it interesting. The characters were a different group from what I have encountered before; sometimes funny.
      <br />I really liked this book. The characters were so normal and relatable. You have Ember, a girl that is going through life and trying to figure out how to live after a tragedy. Then you have Vance, a guy trying to deal with a tragedy and a very uncertain future. I liked that there was not an instal...
      Great little nostalgic novella. I had a lot of good laughs reading this book, and it brought up many childhood memories.
      A graphic novel that interweaves a fairy-cautionary tale about changing what should be with a hopes and aspirations of a determined, take-charge-with-no-apologies, bossy chef. House spirits, posh menus, and uber cute waitstaff included. A super fun, delicious, creative tale.
      Re-read this childhood favorite, and it's still good. He does an excellent job of portraying precocious children and Ender's moral struggles. The school dynamics are so vivid, as are all the games and simulations. A science fiction classic!

      Jenson and Mia take you on a journey full of anger, hurt, and love. Another great book that I became addicted to and couldn't put down (unless I had to)!!

      Lake of Dreams by Linda Howard is a scary at times, suspenseful, and passionate read. I really enjoyed this novella, and felt that the length was perfect for the story being told.<br /><br />Linda's descriptions of the main characters, especially how Thea sees Richard brought them vividly to life and at time...
      Useful if sometimes over the top.
      Good, quick read with a sweet ending.
      Okay I've read this entire trilogy in freaking 3 days!!! That's how good it is. The plot is just soooo good and yeah. I watched the movies as well today and they were really good. 100% recommending this book to everybody!!!
      The life of a gorilla told by the gorilla. Fast paced and very interesting. It tugged at my heartstrings and I'm not a real animal person.
      This author continues to simply stagger me with every single piece of work he delivers into my hands! As I am discovering is his particular talent, Mr. Witt has produced a thought-provoking look into the realities of the effects of human anger and resultant capacity for savagery. Woven throughout...
      I really enjoyed this book from the beginning. It was fast paced without being rushed and the characters were each fleshed out and human. A great story involving search dogs which is a new topic for me which got my interest from the start. Easily read and entertaining.
      <strong>Great book!</strong><br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sebastian Rudd is the man and hopefully there will be a sequel because I enjoyed this character.
      El mejor final para una de las mejores series que he leido! <br /><br />
      Ginger brought the reader a picture of Elvis the man, rather than the king. She loved him a great deal and made him happy in his last days. Touching and lovely to read.
      So far I enjoy Tana French's books. she has great storylines. I love her style of writing. loved the ending of the book.
      Another great read from Ms. Voxley. I love this series. It's fun. It's sexy. It's a very entertaining read. I highly recommend this book and series.<br /><br />- - Gifted ARC copy - -<br />L.
      book was better than the film despite changing the ending.
      Audiobook.
      Terrifying thriller of a reporter, Jack McEvoy who blends in an investigation of a serial killer. The victims are homicide detectives, including McEvoy's twin brother. The killer's clues are from Edgar Allan Poe''s writings. Who the killer is, surprised me. Great!
      <strong>To be remembered</strong><br /><br />Very well written with quips original and unmistakable as language of the hills. Loved that about Olivia, as well as her stubborn independence.

      <strong>Surprising</strong><br /><br />OK, not what I was excepting. But a great read . If you love this series then this is a must read. We had been waiting for Gabby and Gary's book for so long and it was worth the wait
      This is a sweet little book that I really enjoyed until the end when it got a bit too freaky-deaky.

      <strong>Great way to end a wonderful series</strong><br /><br />I loved seeing everything come full circle and that most of the demons were worked out. I hope Con gets his own story but we shall wait and see! Great read!
      love, love, love this series!
      Series continues to be interesting, humorous and inventive.
      I ended up really liking this book! It began slow for me and I wasn't sure if I was going to take to it but I had really been wanting to try a Jenny Han book. It picked up quickly and I really enjoyed the relationship between the main character and the boy pretending to be her boyfriend.
      <strong></strong><br /><br />Good book, I enjoyed it. I would reccomend it to my friends, but it would be more fun if they started with #one
      This picture book has wonderful illustrations, simple text as a bear politely continues asking various animals if they've seen his hat...then ends with a hilariously dark joke. Love it!
      An unexpected best friends turned lovers romance. I really enjoyed all the humor in this book, it made their friendship more believable.<br /><br />Thanks Netgalley for the free review copy, in exchange for an honest review.
      I adored this book! The author is a popular UK blogger but I hadn't hear of her-- just stumbled upon the book and it was fab. I listened to the audiobook on this one and the narrator did a great job too. Such a cute, well told love story.
      I loved "The Darlings" and I loved this. Cristina Alger really knows how to involve the reader in a character and a story. This was unpredictable and lovely and surprising in the best ways, and I'd hand it over to anyone in need of a good, engrossing read.
      I guess this is my favorite book of all time.
      <strong>My first Holly Black book - of whom I am now a fan, *sighs/fangirls*</strong><br /><br />Beautiful, beautiful story written oh-so well. No disappointments or awkwardnesses - just so smooth and magical and lovely and real. I am so happy, having devoured this deliciously told story.
      I found Growing up Greene by Charles L. Gaby to be a wonderful memory of growing up in small town usa. The stories were told in a wonderful manner and were fun to read. Great job Charles I look forward to reading more by this talented author.
      Another wonderful collection of tales from the pen of Bob Brooks. Free to buy too - well worth a look. Very traditional stories, in the vein of Animals of Farthing Wood.
      <strong>Wouldn't know</strong><br /><br />I never once opened this book. You know how it goes in college. My professor required it and we never used it
      I officially LOVE the dempseys . this was such a fun book with so many twists .
      The book in the movie are both quite good.<br />Irish girl comes to Brooklyn in about 1950.
      War has come, bringing with it massive destruction, death and taken its toll on the Nightside and its residents. There's no escape from this problem, no way to bluff past Lilith, until John works one final trick, bringing his life and the story full circle. <br /><br />Great way to end the overreaching arc,...
      Very fun.

      loved it . funny, romantic .. played with all of my emotions and totally had me wrapped in it . made me start to read all of the authors books .
      I loved this book so much. It showed how painful high school drama can be, but how eventually you can get over it. Life can be slightly difficult when you are a teenager. Lara Jean shows a good example of how to deal with it well.
      G and I both loved this, but want to know which rat it was who died at the end.
      I really enjoyed this book, even though I have no memory or knowledge of the Shakespeare play it mirrors. Christopher Moore is definitely an author I'll seek more of.
      <strong>Thriller mystery </strong><br /><br />Intriguing story pulls you in from the start. Interesting characters lead the story through the action. Greatly enjoyed setup, anxious for more.<br /><br /><br />

      I enjoyed this much much more than I thought I would, it's so easy to read- almost like a children's book, yet the content is clearly intended for adults only with the gore that makes it a typical thriller.

      This book was beautifully written. Loved the changes in points of view. For the animal lovers, this one will touch your heart.
      While clear in purpose if not necessarily plot, "Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck is a triumph of literary prose - a poetically told Depression era tale that leaves you feeling as if you just read a song as well as a story.
      I really enjoyed reading this. I'm glad that I read the book first, because after watching half of the film, the book goes into so much more depth. This was very fast paced, and the author didn't drag it out to make it a longer story than it was.
      It's an excellent read told by a powerful storyteller who asks some very good questions. It isn't that much different from a lot of other anecdotal medicine books out there, in my opinion.
      Finally a Song of Ice and Fire book that is possible to read in a week without feeling overwhelmed! Though admittedly, this is only half of the third book. This has been my favourite in the series so far as there have been some really interesting developments now that I feel I know who all of the...

      <strong>Brilliant</strong><br /><br />A sweet, hilarious, easy-reading trio of books! I love all the characters intermingled with each other and that small town feel! Makes me want to find Buttermilk Falls!!
      <strong>Love it!</strong><br /><br />This book sucks you into the story quickly, I did not even want to put it down from the moment I started reading it.I am going and getting the rest of the series.I don't want it to end.
      a little slow to start. entering a new universe can be painful because you do not understand ANY OF THE WORDS. an interesting story.
      Could not put down. Werewolves with a difference. Alternate universe with "Others" in charge of things.

      Good follow up to the 5th Wave. More insight into the other characters. Really like this one.
      inspired me to read more fairy tale twists....
      Stevens is quite the fabulous narrator. The movie was also excellent, though I prefer the final scene in the book.
      <strong>Interesting read!</strong><br /><br />It is a quick read! Grabs and keeps your attention! I would recommend to young adults and adults! I enjoyed it
      <strong>Holy hotness</strong><br /><br />I'm not usually a baseball fan, but I was all over this insta love book. I am definitely in favor of the jelly legs caused by the alpha and this book hit all the right spots. Kasey was a bit much in the beginning, but I enjoyed the humor she brought in the end.
      Well well well.... I love when you receive an arc for a new novel with a new author and it blows you away. This was THAT STORY I was Sucked in from the 1st page.<br />Beth has a simple life a palliative care nurse that lives with her best friend Grady. His gay love for Beth is not only heartwarming but...

      <strong>Not like any other book!!!</strong><br /><br />This was a great book by a by a new author! I love to read but honestly all books end the same and have similar story lines. This book was different in so many ways and I couldn't put it down!!!
      <strong>Very good. </strong><br /><br />It took me a little while to get into this book. Maybe a few chapters where I just skimmed and then it started to get ready good and I couldn't put it down. Cried at some parts. Laughed a lot at some parts and loved every single part of this book that I read. First time reading from th...

      SO MANY FEELINGS. SO SO SO GOOD.
      Wah fighting-nya cakep gila!!!
      <strong>More great stories</strong><br /><br />Mr. Sellers books cover a wide range of the notorious, and this one was no exception. Many grisly cases I hadn't heard of before.
      I liked this one for basically the same reasons I liked the last one. It was cozy, and is just someone's daily life, and I'm definitely in the mood for that right now. In fact, I read all three of these books between 7 pm last night and 3 am this morning, and had a great time.<br /><br />But if reading about...
      We need more books like this. People who are different. White people are a tired story.
      In this book all of the guys end up together for Jonathan and Cole's wedding in Paris. All of them have changed so much, and they actually reach some understandings they never thought they would. I really liked this story and just seeing them all come to a good place with their partners and their...
      THIS BOOK HAD ME SO EXCITED! I love backstory or any kind of story and this book filled me with happiness! Derek Landy, as per usual, did not let me down! :)

      Great fun series, really enjoyed this fantasy world.
      <strong>very good </strong><br /><br />liked the series fell in love with each of the Cowboys..... I read the blues series and loved it I enjoyed this one too
      I used this book for my senior research project on child development. The book offered great insight on how the child's mind works and I was able to get a lot of information for my project. However, the book itself seemed to drag on a little bit in my opinion. The authors over-elaborated on the g...
      A really good conclusion to the series. A little on the long side though.
      Empowering children's book that encourages children to follow their dreams, and never be afraid of failure, because the only failure can come if you quit. I especially enjoyed the connection to Rosie the Riveter, an icon for women empowerment. While the book empowers all children, the connection...
      This book was amazing, I was at a very hard time in my life with no escape. For whatever reason I always went to the library but never read a book. Then the Librarian had me check this out, in sheer boredom and loneliness I began to read on the hour long bus ride home. I will forever be grateful...
      It's an amazing work of Awan. I highly recommend this eBook for all the SEOs and bloggers who are straggling with link building.

      The stories are getting much better. This was a lot of fun. And, the plot thickens!

      <strong>OMD!!!!!</strong><br /><br />I gave it 5 stars, it was well written and well thought out,the plot was exceptional and made you want to send out a probe telling the Delroi to hurry up and arrive. If you get any book get this one . I bought it as a Birthday gift for myself and it was my best gift .

      This English Brothers boxed set includes the first four full-length novels from Katy Regnery's Blueberry Lane series about Barrett, Fitz, Alex and Stratton. Prepare yourself to fall in love with these insanely handsome blond and blue-eyed English brothers! A fair warning: they are absolutely addi...
      The character development is fantastic. The character of Colton is more than just words on a page, he become real the more you read. He is accused of murdering his wife, and his child is rendered literally speechless after his mother's brutal death. This story is a prime example of presumed guilt...
      Five stars for the pictures alone. The whole thing is surreal and evocative. A child's bigger-than-life imagination. So large even dreams can't hold it.
      I don't normally enjoy young adult books, but this trilogy one kept catching my attention, and I finally caved in and purchased he 3 books. Iam so glad Idid! Ireally enjoyed this first book. This was probably the best book Ihave read in a long while, and deffinitely the best young adult book I ha...
      Horrific and heart wrenching true story about a young girl's life. She grows up in a dysfunctional family, neglected, and emotional abused. She then gets kidnapped by someone she knows and is kept in this coffin box and repeatedly sexually abused. It took her years to tell her story after extensi...
      Not my favorite Vonnegut book, but the ending makes it more than worth the read.
      Loved it :)
      Good story. Sad but very informative for those not familiar with this part of our history.
      <strong>Worth every dime!!!</strong><br /><br />I am an avid George Heyer fan! I have had this book on my wishlist for several years. Due to some of the top reviews mentioning that this book is all about Heyer's money struggles and a seemed to hint that she wasn't a very interesting person, I had put off buying it. Those oth...
      كفاية ان الرواية دي طلعت من واحد مبدع عنده 15 سنة و معظم اللي في سنه دلوقتي جيل لا يفقه شيء في شيء<br />الرواية محيرة جداً و محتاجة تركيز عشان تقدر تربط بين أحداثها و ممتعة و النهاية كانت غير متوقعة<br />بالتوفيق في الرواية الجديدة ان شاء الله
      Supernatural tales that leave you emotionally exhausted. It's a tough feat to pull off, but Nathan Ballingrud does it in spades.<br /><br />Sure, there's a predictable moment and a clunker or two in this collection of short fiction, but even at it's low points, the stories are undeniably human and very, very...
      Matt Alfredson was part of a research group based in the tiny village of Anaktue, filming wildlife in Alaska in the middle of winter.

      Absolutely amazing start to a series! A fun mystery read set in Nocturne Falls. Cant wait to read the next and see what happens with all the elves and the store.<br />
      This was a refreshing, unique take on the paranormal genre. Trinity is a foster child who is looked after with more compassion by her best friend (and best friend's mother) than she is by her own foster mother (or foster monster as she is often referred to in the novel, much to my glee). Trinity...
      <strong>Fun and Sexy</strong><br /><br />Love the sarcasm and banter between Blake and Jennifer. However, I could done with less of her dramatics. Blake has shown time and again that he deserved the good benefit of doubt of his love for Jennifer. Because love is a powerful emotion that wins every time.
      This is by far the best book in the series but I've been waiting and hoping for Sebastian's book. It did not disappoint!! Got to learn a lot about his past and the who and whys as to the way he is not going to say much else because that would ruin it. This is a must read!!<br />
      A Searching Heart is a gentle, thoughtful novel that perfectly captures the feelings of a young woman stuck between the situation of childhood and the wide-open world of adulthood—when she’s already crossed the threshold of womanhood in both mind and body. As usual, Janette Oke masterfully portra...
      Good read full of surprising events
      Destined to be a classic tale of friendship and overcoming fears.<br />This wonderfully illustrated book tells a simple but effective story that will encourage children to overcome nighttime fears, especially with the help of others. I hope this unlikely friendship of Mole and Wolf continues to flouris...
      An enchanting read!!
      I received an ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It is the first book by PJ Adams that I have read and I now want to meet more. Jess Taylor goes for a long over due visit to see her grandparents in an assisted living center. She learns that her grandmother...
      Absolutely amazing read!! I have read everything by this author and she is a great writer, she creates wonderful characters that you cant help but love or hate as well as an amazing world. This is a fast read with sex scenes so if thats not your thing.
      four stars for the stories but only 2.5 for the stories' matrix story.
      What a powerful, practical book for those sick and those who want to stay healthy! Dr. Butterworth is a pastor and doctor in South Africa and has seen much. In this book he brings together the relationship between unforgiveness and sickness. He gives practical steps to forgiving those in your lif...
      A good ghostly mystery. I liked the characters voices. Action and humor.
      This is a great, beautiful and inspirational collection.<br /><br />I became aware of GS through Jack Kerouac and the Beats. Having said that though, GS - in my opinion - is no beat. He stands on his own. His background is Zen Buddhist; mine isn't. He writes mainly about his "own space", namely, Turtle Islan...
      <strong>cool</strong><br /><br />This book has taught me a lot. However I don't agree with a few aspects. Doesn't mean I'm not going to see if they work for myself!
      Fast action..tense..excellently written
      A solid standalone romance that you will just not be able to put down.<br />Fake relationships always seem to be a good idea but they never seem to run to plan, so when Reed claps eyes on his cheating ex and the a$$ that used to be his best mate he is none too pleased as having to spend any time in the...
      Loved Sam and Tiel!<br /><br />Sam's story in the Walsh family series is a winner! Sam has so much baggage and problems that you know that this is going to be an involved story from the beginning. When he meets Tiel as they are trapped in an elevator in her apartment building, you see that they are very diff...
      I really enjoyed this book and would've given it five stars had it not been for the ending. I found the ending mildly confusing given that it didn't seem to fit with any of the story. I think it made the entire plot-line seem a bit pointless but it was very good until that point. It is obvious wh...
      Not as good as Shutter Island but still pretty good. Was fast to read through too- didn't take me very long. I felt that some of the characters were hard to relate to but otherwise a great read.
      Non. Stop. Requests.
      I loved this book! Super exciting. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Read it in 2 days!
      read those two ( + shadow and bone ) a while ago and absolutely loved them !!!!
      A very good historical novel. The author links real life events very well like the charge of incest and one of Anne Boleyn's babies being disfigured and deformed. Of Philippa Gregory's novels that I have read this is definitely my favourite. Very factual and detailed and easy to read.
      I found this book at a thrift store. That night at bedtime, my daughter and I were laughing hysterically over the antics of this worm. I think I might have liked the book more than my 7 year old. Great read!! and cannot wait to find more books by Doreen Cronin!
      Aberrant Fairytale is another gem, Aibhlinn is mourning over the love of her life, her soulmate,Malachi, just existing from one day to the next, until she realizes she has to uncover the secrets which are the key to her past and her future. With burning determination she sets out to find her trut...
      <strong>Enticing Read</strong><br /><br />Well written story line with complex likable characters. Plenty of steamy sex scenes with a generous helping of action. This story is well worth the read!
      favorite of the series
      I thoroughly enjoyed this journal. I like that the author added the reasons for keeping this journal and the benefits of writing, I also love the inspirational quotes at the end of the book, that encourage people to think and write about what the motivations mean to them, For me, keeping a journa...
      <strong>Fun and cute</strong><br /><br />I love how the book started. You got to know the key players and love them. Even when the truth comes out. All and all it was a cute short story.
      fave!
      *Copy received through NetGalley, courtesy of The Book Enthusiast as part of the #30DayReadingIndie Challenge.*<br />I did not read the two first books in the " Love in the City Series " books.

      .... lot to take in....
      A prisoner ends up taking on the identity of an army investigator and searches for a German spy.<br /><br />The basic story and characters were good, but in places the plot and writing were a bit laboured.<br /><br />Real rating 3.5
      <strong>Perfect Follow-up</strong><br /><br />Wonder what happens after graduation? Wonder no farther, thus book perfectly explains the next step in this wonderful story of Brie's journey through submission.
      <strong>Adventure series with unlikely heroes</strong><br /><br />A depressed journalist befriends a young PhD and the two begin an adventure steeped in history as dark as a pot of tea left on the stove for hours. Hard to put down, plenty of plot twists, and an excellent use of history blended with current events to make for...
      I think this will be my last Crombie for a while but I do like her plotting and characters. Just enough excitement to keep the reading interesting.
      Short, straight to her points, inspiring.
      One of the best books i've ever read in my whole life. Absolutely addictive. Once you start reading you can't stop till the last page.
      Very insightful.
      <strong>Great story.</strong><br /><br />So never a dull moment. Again author Jaymin Eve has spun a fantastic story. Love all the twists and turns, the off color humor and the wonderful characters.
      <strong>Wow-just-WOW! Great Shifter read!!</strong><br /><br />Let me first say that I don't give five stars out unless I feel it is a classic OR the book makes me want to read MORE!! This cliffhanger of an ending is leaving me with such a book hangover! I want more! I must continue to the NEXT...like NOW! <br />Every page turned...
      Liked this series, but was a little too predictable for me to love it. Characters were kinda simple and the usual plot lines? The Barbour Romance collections are always worth the read for me, but this collection was not one of my favorites?
      Oh my goodness! Melissa Foster has done it again! Claimed by Love is absolutely amazing! Duke and Gabriella are such a great swoon worthy couple. I literally laughed out loud then cried real tears! Such a beautiful heartwarming couple, you will fall in love right along with them! I'm so sad that...
      Molly McLain has again caught my attention with this book and left me wanting more, waiting for the next book to come out. Colton is all over the country with his bike but keeps coming home to Taylor. Taylor is in their small home town and cannot wait to get out. Will the two of them, best friend...
      <strong>Far from my normal genre</strong><br /><br />Very impressed with this young author. She's certainly one to watch. Since this is far outside the type of books I usually read, I approached it with an open mind. <br /><br />And I'm glad I did.
      It was AWESOME!!!!!
      The book had interesting characters and I, generally, liked the story. However, I find it highly distracting when words break across lines and pages. In addition, I saw several places that were missing commas, which always takes me out of the story.
      Loved the adventure and humour of this story! Good fun for young and old.
      The book “Strays” by Ron Koertge is about Ted O’Connor who isn’t the usual teen, he has an unique ability and because of this ability he isn’t very popular, social or liked.

      This book changed my opinion on diamonds and I will never support the diamond industry again. An even scarier link - who diamonds are used to fund terrorism around the world.
      Though I haven't read all the books in this series, I have been totally into the ones I have and plan to read them all. I was very excited to get a copy of this one.

      This book was great.
      If you are going through a tough time or even if you are looking for a good spiritual pick me up. This book is recommended for anyone who could use a little hope.
      An amazing book that every marketer should read... Definitely one of the best I've read in 2016!!!

      In Dark Pants Number One, artist Matt MacFarland gives us a fast paced, page-turning narrative. The illustrations in the graphic novel are stunning.

      It's irreverent, funny and completely genius! <br />Full review here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://abookloverswalk.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-humans-by-matt-haig.html" rel="nofollow">http://abookloverswalk.blogspot.com/2...</a>
      Loved it!
      At the same time funny and dark; this was also really informative, both in terms of what actually happens to your body after death, as well as the cultural and historical rituals of death.
      K.C. has easily done it again with “Sweet Love”. We get a glimpse into the lives of the Evans family, Sawyer, Grace, Hope, and Parker with this story of sweet, sweet, love. The sexy alpha Sawyer is back ladies and he does not disappoint. Still that sweet, dirty talking, alpha husband that we all...
      An excellent and very easily readable adventure. As most novels from that era it is actually very realistic (to me it is more believable than aliens landing etc.)and left me feeling that if I followed the descriptions of the journey, I could have the same adventure. Almost like a travelog.The lan...

      A fun ride as always. At times crazy dark, but MJ, Heath and Gillie make it all worth while. I didn't realize she was ending the series though. That makes me sad.
      Brilliantly written!!
      I have really enjoyed the characters in this series about wolves that have recently claimed their mates. It did not start out as well as they hoped and they have had to make a lot of adjustments <br /><br />In this part of the story, in addition to the two couples from the first book, we are introduced to Ve...

      I was given a copy for a fair and honest review.<br /><br />I have not read many books in this genre, but I loved this book. It had everything a great book should have - great writing, great characters and a story that grabs you and never lets you go. I was so wrapped up in this story, I almost burned dinner...
      Loved this book. I like her postcard format at the first of each chapter and love the adventures she has. I plan on rereading this one and have lent it to many.
      I listened to the audiobook version, which I highly recommend. Great narrator.
      I was sent a copy of this book for review purposes, as always, all opinions are my own<br /><br />There are many things I look forward to after a long winter—sunshine is obviously one of them, but the new Spring cookbook releases may even beat out the prospect of warmer weather and flip flops. In the past fe...
      This is a heartwarming and tear jerking story of a mans love for his dog. It was incredibly well written and so easy to relate to. I am more of a cat person but could certainly understand the special relationship between a person and their pet.
      Just charming and delightful.
      This book was huge for me. Full of useful insights.
      <strong>As fun to read as Evanovitch. </strong><br /><br />Good story, characters, and dialogue. Actually laughed out loud. Looking forward to the next book, and others in the series.
      Rocket-Bye, by award-winning author Carol P Roman, is a delightful bedtime poem sure to bring sweet dreams to young children. Illustrator Mateya Arkova beautifully portrays the story with muted colors and charming pictures. Youngsters will climb on a rocket ship and become pirates of the sky as t...
      <strong>My goodness!</strong><br /><br />Couldn't put it down! What depressing set of circumstances! Is it great to be the queen? For that I will save my opinion,because some may say, " YES..
      <strong>Great</strong><br /><br />Great writing, great story and leaves you wanting to read more. Luckily it's only the first in the trilogy, and I have the other two!
      Chris Riddell's dark illustrations suit Gaiman's mash-up of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.
      <strong>Promises part 2</strong><br /><br />Loved this book. It is a lengthy tale..which is unusual in today's market. IMO, it points out that in today's world we need to be careful..also not judge people by appearances. Money does not make someone "law abiding". And if you seek you will find that perfect person...

      What a wonderful Christmas story. Widower Martin Rhodes needs help with his six children. Ruth was just laid off from her job and is an answer to Martin's fervent prayer.

      <strong>Great story!</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It had an original storyline with easy to lobe characters. Can't wait to start book 2.
      <strong>Excellent</strong><br /><br />I was kept on my toes through this whole book. Couldn't put it down, didn't know what was gonna happen next! Awesome
      Read this young and adored it!
      Love Adams sense of humor!!!
      <strong>He did it again....</strong><br /><br />Slow burn is a series that I have read many times. Love the characters, love the story. Bobby brings Zed and Murphy back again for more mayhem and Null spot the destroyer. He brought someone else back too... :-)
      Historia, misterio, arte. <br />Simplemente perfecto
      Really great read! Couldn't put it down (:
      I love this book! Read it several times!

      My heart hurts.
      <strong>A great story of forgiveness, faith, and love</strong><br /><br />Where do I even start? I loved this story - probably my favorite in the series so far. The emotions , the way the story was told, everything!! And dang it - Isaacson made me cry again!!!
      Bukunya bagus, bacanya hampir sebulan, hahaaha... Ini buku nohok banget dah, banyak yg perlu diperbaiki for myself dlm masalh komunikasi
      I read this over spring break. It was an Amazon freebie. I was very interested in the characters and the genre. I will be looking for the sequels!
      This is #25 in the series which says a lot for it right there. Sandford tells great stories that are believable. This book has more of Letty in it which is great. I hope she keeps appearing as she gets older and maybe even break off into a series of her own.
      <strong>If you have writer's block</strong><br /><br />Give this a read! This book is a great reminder to not take yourself too seriously. Pick your pen back up (or your paintbrush or your microphone) and get creating.

      After reading Stiletto Safari I decided I would read Stiletto Sunset and read it in one sitting. Again this was a light happy read. Zara moves to London with her Hamish but really misses her friends in New York. The story is well written and very enjoyable.
      Beautifully written book.
      divertido... sessão da tarde total ;)
      I wish there was some way to add a "favorite book' on goodreads. I would a million times over pick this wonderfully transcendent novel.
      good book
      Perfect combination of romance and mystery!
      Loved this book!!
      THIS IS THE FOURTH BOOK IN DIANE CAPRI'S JACK REACHER SERIES. WELL PACED SUSPENSE. OTTO AND GASPAR CONTINE THEIR EXCITING SEARCH. AS ALWAYS, KEEPS YOU WANTING TO READ MORE. HARD TO PUT DOWN AND REALLY LIKE THE CHARACTERS
      Don't read this one unless you have access to Copper River as well, this one book in his series ends as a cliff-hanger and I had to wait to find a copy of the next book.

One thing I...
      I enjoy Lord Hawke and his "crew"...Ambrose Congreave, Stokely Jones, Froggie. Totally improbably but fun nonetheless. This tale involved Islamic terrorists in the jungle of Brazil planning an automated attack on the Inauguration of the U.S. President.
      "A thrilling "true" story, about a teenager who sails around the world, ALONE, her cat is her only companion. Tania Aebi blooms with courage and tenacity. I loved this book. I cried at the ending."
      So helpful, amazing styles, detailed instructions.
      <strong>Awesome book</strong><br /><br />This was a great book. The power of forgiveness is key. I can understand how to let go and let God be in control.
      <strong>Good</strong><br /><br />If you like shifter stories that are straight to the point with a little humor on the side this one is for you.
      I was provided an arc in exchange for an honest review and that review is going to be short and to the point.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Laramie Briscoe and her Heaven Hill series.

      Bees have been a hot topic for a few years now, primarily due to the mysterious deaths of entire colonies and the ensuing research to try and figure out what was going wrong. However, bees have been vital to our lives and our economy for many, many years before that. This humble insect pollinates...

      This story really shows you the resiliency of the human spirit.

      I started this as soon as I finished the first book in the series. I love them and don't want to do anything else until I'm done reading.<br />Starting book 3 today...
      <strong>Wonderful book</strong><br /><br />Terrific imaginative story of learning life (many times over) by being a dog learning its purpose in life. Love and loyalty.
      Possibly the best one of the trilogy, it takes the protagonist, and the reader, right to the foot of cross in awe of the work of God in that wondrous time.
      4.5 stars
      I quite like how Douglas Coupland writes. This is a good one.
      A different read for me. But enjoyed it.
      Great book. I really like this whole series.
      A really beautiful story about friendship, life and what comes after.

      I started the book on wattpad. I really didn't expect it to be sooooo damn good I knocked senseless  totally a must read
      It was a great thriller and I didn't suspect the true evil until it practically was in front of me, the story was interesting and kept me thinking about all the possible suspects. Looking firearm to trying the next in this series!
      <strong>Loved it</strong><br /><br />Lani, you did again! Awesome story, easy to relate to....felt like you took me on a journey of my own life lol
      great descriptions, a nice change with an interesting set of circumstances
      great read
      This is pretty cute. If you're expecting Shakespeare, read Shakespeare. This is good for what it is.
      This is a book that pulls you in and never lets you go. The story captivated me from the very beginning and just kept getting better as it went on. The character depth was outstanding. These are characters that you easily fall in love with and become so involved with their story. <br /><br />I love my rocker...
      Very convicting. Need to realize the importance of giving.
      This does not conclude the story of MacBeth, bu it does conclude the story for the witches three. And it's done brilliantly. Maybe a little too nicely tidied up at the end, or it felt rushed after all of the animosity, but it worked and was well done so it's only a mild complaint.
      4.5 stars
      Love anything by the Judy!
      I want to read more. I learned so much about life in London and while there was some intense medical scenes, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The next book is waiting at the library for me.
      Gripping from beginning to end - simply could not put it down - a must read .....
      I’m not a big fan of the fake boyfriend trope, so I wasn’t sure what I was going to think about this when I realized that was where it was headed. However, I ended up loving this book, for a multitude of reasons. Angel/Aiden is a realist - in order to do what he needs done, he must do what he mig...
      <strong>Great Book!</strong><br /><br />As someone who helped raised my younger siblings while still young I could relate to Julian. I love his and Emma's relationship and the entire Blackthorn clan. I can't wait for the next book.

      Facade by Kim Carmichael is a first time read for me. I wasn't sure what to expect in this story as I jumped into reading it with no knowledge of what it would be about.

      <strong>Holy Catfish this book ROCKS</strong><br /><br />I loved Bones, and I want to BE Cat. For anyone who loves paranormal romance, give this one a go.<br />Best novel I've read lately.<br />I'll definitely be looking for more from Jeaniene Frost.
      This book is very short, but very good.
      So fun to be back in Lou's world. Really enjoyed it. Kiiiiiiiiiiind of unbelievable at times, but still very good.
      I read this years ago, but as with all VC Andrews, it was well written, fast paced and a good story.
      Five stars!<br /><br /> I havent read a series in years where i have been on the edge of my seat! This one clearly takes the cake. All the characters and plot twists are very fast paced, and the plot keeps thickening as the story goes on. <br /><br />Highly recommend to finish all 6 books in the series! Hey, Stephen Kin...
      <strong>So good!</strong><br /><br />Loved this book I could not put it down. I really got involved in the characters and I loved that there was not to much drama! Had a feel good vibe about it.
      A spectacular ending to a really engaging series!
      <strong>Fun</strong><br /><br />This book was a fun an entertaining read. If you like witches and mystery then you will enjoy this book. Going to continue reading the rest of the series!
      I thought that this was an excellent book that was easy to read and practical. So many things I'm reading are too quick to say that everyone is different.

      Sweet, enjoyable. A nice read. Not amazing, but I would recommend it.
      Loved this book!
      A wonderful introduction for children to the world of microbes, good and bad. A great addition to the elementary school library!
      I sincerely hope there is more to this branch of the Outlander story! I love these two characters.
      I picked up the book because of it was labelled 'spiritual horror' and it certainly delivers on that front. It's an intriguing and fascinating story that is frightening and clever. After another split from her boyfriend Shane, Jael moves away and via the Internet gets involved with Mike. Soon her...
      Beautiful.
      <strong>Another Spectacular Yarros story</strong><br /><br />What wasn't to like? The characters and backgrounds were so rich and full. Bash and Emmy were an amazing couple with their own flaws. They worked through it all and built something bigger than themselves. For a novella, the story was deep and the emotions were raw....
      Great book. Loved every page. Never saw the ending coming.

      Depressing story. But I love the author's creative descriptions and her ability to write.
      <strong>Can't wait to read #2</strong><br /><br />Loved this first book in the Strand brothers series. A very strong alpha male and a very strong female. The actual storyline wasn't finished, so hope it takes up, where this one left off.
      This book is not just for kids, good for any age reader!
      <strong>A great entertaining read</strong><br /><br />A good plot with a number of twists and turns. I found it difficult to put down and would recommend it to all the " who dunnit" readers
      A wonderful tale of everyone deserves a second chance and never judge a person by reputation there are always three sides to every story
      The book was good but it took me a while to get into it and finish.

      My very favorite Pearl Buck. One of my favorite novels of all time.

      A fun novella about Yelena and Valeki stopping a plot to steal the Ice Moon. Short, but provides some good back story for Shadow Study.
      Love this timeless book. plus being in Boston makes it extra special.
      A quick, fun read. Math content area connections - maybe not strong enough to use the whole novel in class, but a chapter might make for a good in-class read. Themes of bullying.
      WOW love the movie
      <strong>Excellent read!</strong><br /><br />Victoria captures you from the moment you begin cheering for Mare to the final page. I am losing sleep waiting to get my hands on Glass Sword!

      "Escaped the Night” by Jennifer Blyth was one of the most unexpectedly awesome books I’ve read in a while.

      This book is worth all the hype. I can't put into words why, but I identify so much with the narrator.
      4 Stars. I really enjoyed this series. I wish the epilogue was a little more in depth.

      <strong>Amazing</strong><br /><br />I believe that only few people can write this well and that is why we only know few authors .
      Hunt really knows Science fiction. Within his plot there is refernce to Ray Bradbury, and Huxley. Professor Amelia Hunt is a female version of Indiana Jones, with action and adventure included.
      Oh my. I read this book in the 8th grade: I can say it was one of the only time my whole class were so engaged in a activity. Always talking about what we thought was going to happen next. Truly good memories come to mind when I think of this book.! Recommend it to anyone!
      I loved the version and having read the book after I would say it's a very faithful adaptation. It's what got me into the mystery genre!

      Excellent saga of the railroads vs the wheat farmers in Central California in the 1880's. The book depicts the author's fictionalized account of the Mussel Slough tragedy. This is a slow read, written in 1901, in the style of older writers. Nevertheless, I loved it!

      Parts 1 and 2: very good, interesting and well argued. Part 3? Not so much. A bit of an awkward exercise to extrapolate their prior findings to explain global warming - unecessary.

      It’s a Melissa Foster book and it’s Duke Ryder! That is all I should have to say for this review. <br />You need to read this book! I fell in love right from the get go. Duke is everything that I dreamed him to be. I have been waiting for what seems like forever for his HEA. He is such a compassionate,...
      Gorgeous. Real. Hilarious and heartrending.
      <strong>Requested nightly</strong><br /><br />My three-year-old has requested this book every night this week. He likes the art and silly story. What a great bargain.
      <strong>Really enjoyed this book</strong><br /><br />I read this book while on vacation--coincidentally--in San Francisco. I was actually in Stinson Beach &amp; Muir Woods the same day I read those parts. Anyway, I still enjoyed the story and the way it came full circle.
      <strong>Good read</strong><br /><br />This was a very good read. Why did Terrance come BBC back and try to kill Madison? He was obviously gay. What was his motive? Did the dad and the doctor take it to the next level in their relationship? Did Room and Madison work through her issues? There were a lot of unanswered questions...
      First of all, let me say that I love the Bayou Billionaires. I've read the first two books and loved each. They are sexy and fun. Of course, I have read other books by authors of these books, so I knew that these were going to be great.<br /><br />Now, I have to comment on the hot guy on the cover. Ooo La La...
      <strong>Great read</strong><br /><br />If you've ever wanted something that was probably unattainable and hoped it would come to fruition. Then this book is for you. Well written and a joy to read. The characters dance a dance of uncertainty that finally resolves itself. You'll love Jake and Russ. But the young character wil...
      <strong>Dancers Heart</strong><br /><br />Wilde Creek is one of my favorite places to read about, so many good things happen there. Also alot of exciting things happen to. Lots of Wolves willing to kick some backsides to keep their mates safe. Amazing story, I can't wait to see what happens next.
      The book "boy in striped pajamas" was a very good read. You see the wars through eyes of children who were often overlooked. You also see it through two different perspectives, Bruno the son of a elite German army general and shule a Jewish boy whose father was a a watchmaker. There friendship gr...
      I read this with my oldest son and cried.
      Compelling
      <strong>Known hacks but simplicity helped</strong><br /><br />I knew most of the hacks given and actually use some on a day to day basis but the simplicity that they were written with made the rest of them seem possible. I left the corporate world to be a SAHM and struggle daily. I came across this while looking for somethin...
      <strong>So much love &amp; sincerity </strong><br /><br />This was a great, nerdy, awkward coming-of-age romance. The struggles with money, making choices you don't want to because you think "it's for the best", trying to not ask for help &amp; finally doing it...this book has a lot of heart &amp; feels very genuine. <br /><br />All 3 b...
      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I've been looking for a book like this without even realizing it. Truly put many things in perspective for me a has given me a plan for going forward.
      Wonderful book about love, truth, trust, betrayal and friendship. LOST WITHOUT YOU was written in a unique style. Hope Winters and Raphael Lacroix, known to his friends as Rafe, are the two main characters. The book focuses on their love story and tells the story from each of their perspective. I...
      LOVE!!!!!!!
      First read this in college, forty years ago. Was good to read it again. Age gives a different view.
      <strong>Travels with Bill</strong><br /><br />This is a funny, daydreamy wander of a book, a trip back to 1990 Europe. Bryson retraces a 1970 trip and reflects on the changes in those twenty years. I'd love to read about a redo of this redo--in 2016, are there now Pizza Huts in Sofia?
      <strong>Loved these stories. Sweet quick reads with characters you can relate too</strong><br /><br />Three well developed HEA stories that compliment each other. Will definitely read more from this author! A great set of stories for anyone.
      What the fuck? Is good I like it, it's something refreshing so to speak, is not your usual novel, so it's makes you think
      I really enjoyed this book! I felt like I was part of the story.
      Gorgeous, dark, and creepy - a real fairy tale. No, it's not an "anti-fairy tale" - whoever says that doesn't know what fairy tales are really like. There's plenty of spoilery reviews if you want to learn more. I really enjoyed it.
      <strong>Beautiful</strong><br /><br />This was truly a beautiful book and I wouldn't complain about it. It made me happy and sad but my heart felt so happy in the end. I got the exact story I wanted and I loved it. I hope everyone who reads this loves it as much as I did.
      Manda's 4 Star Review<br /><br />I love,love,love Bella Jewel!! This author consistently releases amazing books. I fell in love with the MC Sinners and have quickly found myself falling in love with the new generation. This book was really good and I read the entire thing in one sitting. I stayed up until th...

It is something that helped Rosa in standing her ground, and standing up for herself when she wasn't being treated fairly or with respect....
      This will give me nightmares. Amazing twist of the story.
      Great little story that isn't what it seems.
      well that was fantastic! I'm starting to like Celaena. it seems she's growing up. And the story... that ending! perfect.
      <strong>Amazing</strong><br /><br />I don't read this type of novel, but this one caught and held my attention. Amazing work. 10/10 would read again. Excited to finish the series!!!
      Galfard's stated aim is not to leave anyone behind and indeed, I could keep up until the start of the last section. First book of heavy cosmology that could take me that far. Call it Brief History of Time for Normal People.
      An enjoyable read, the story takes you on a journey into the world of folklore and myths.
      <strong>A book for anyone that hunts.</strong><br /><br />Something most hunters would dream about..but will never experience. (And may not want to!) And I thought driving to work was dangerous!
      I received this ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review. <br /><br />What a fantastic story this is going to be a great series. Suspense, mystery and romance, it doesn't get any better. Loved this book.
      <strong>Wow</strong><br /><br />A great book!! I lot different than other books ive read. I would highly recommend this book if you like a cliffhanger.
      Aahhhhh! <br />I seriously want to scream from the rooftops how much I loved this book.<br />I was pleasantly surprised this book had a teacher/student spin to it! It just made the book that much more for me!<br />And that just knocked me out!<br /><br />Finn and Brantley just took me by surprise. The way this story unfolded!...
       <br /> "This is a very special book; read with the greatest respect." <br />
      This was a great sequel.
      These aren't just random people's tattoos. One of them was a little known musician I saw a couple years ago. I see you, Thao.

      <strong>Thanks!!!! </strong><br /><br />Thank you so so much for making that into a book!! It was super interesting!! You are the best!!! Thanks again!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! You are amazing!!!! Your ADORER, Brookie the bunny!! (Hehehhehehehe)
      Amazing, highly recommend.
      Between Sade's of Gray was not an easy read but it was a worthy read. It opened up a part of history I was previously unfamiliar with. I would recommend it for people interested in historical fiction.
      For the genre, this book peeked my interest and many have said this book is better than the Da Vinci Code. The author knows how to tell a story and take his readers on a great ride."

      a fascinating glimpse into the personal life of John Steinbeck and into his glorious obsession with marine life.
      *ARC review**<br />Declan, Shannon, and the rest of the gang kept me on my toes throughout the whole book. You never knew what they were going to get into. They had me laughing out loud with all the crazy stuff they get into. There are emotional parts in the book but there was always someone somewhere...
      Reading this book is a project. But such an important one. You'll be looking stuff up as you go, and learning a ton about the heartbreaking, riveting history of our hemisphere.
      Crime writing at its best - Chandler with a tune up meets Shawshank.
      <strong>Helpful to try to understand.</strong><br /><br />I am very uncomfortable with talking to people who have lost anyone but especially children. I feel saying I am sorry is well hollow empty. I feel more apt to be helpful now.
      This is perhaps the most compelling, moving book I have ever read. I can't encourage others enough to please, please read it. It is so important.
      I had read some of the other books in this "series." I liked it.
      Good<br />

      Very good. I really like novels based on real history.
      Duke Ryder just might be the perfect man. He’s loyal, thoughtful, loving, keeps his promises, and he’s HOT. <br /><br />As the story goes, Duke is part of an investment group interested in purchasing Elpitha Island. The island is just off the coast of South Carolina. Gabriella grew up on the island and loves...
      A wonderful introduction to Tremontaine. It breaks my heart that I can't currently afford to buy the rest.
      Good naturalist book for young ones. Pictures and descriptions show the shapes of various trees without leaves plus a few winter animals. He last couple pages contrast a few evergreens. One star deducted because the word rhyming felt forced being read aloud and detracted from the enjoyment.
      A typical Neels book. You know what's going to happen as soon as the heroine says she would only drive to the cottage in the direst circumstances. The one thing I liked though was the hints about what the hero was feeling.
      The story of Benedict and Charlotte, and their relationship, grows throughout the entire story. Both are overcoming obstacles, but are on the same treasure hunting mission, which is what has brought them together. There are enough different elements throughout the story to keep the reader engaged...
      Incredible, absolutely incredible. Okay, so for the first part of this book, I thought it was going to be pretty predictable. Some parts were a little roughly written, but I loved the chemistry between Jake and Holly, their relationship was fun to read, and I was pretty bummed on what happened. T...
      <strong>Great story as always</strong><br /><br />This story was awesome, I wish there was more to it and I hope the next one comes out soon.
      Great fluff.
      A.L. Jackson writes books that feel more like poetry or song lyrics. Her newest novel, Where Lightning Strikes is just another example of her exceptional writing. I always have to plan a little extra time when I start a book by A.L. Jackson. I know that her words and phrases are so lovely that I...

She never thought her ass would be the one receiving those spankings in front of the camera o...
      I laughed. I cried. I fanned my flaming cheeks during a few scenes, if you get my drift. In other words, LET IT BREATHE is hilariously, heartbreakingly, quintessentially Fenske at her best. Who else would come up with that head-butting alpaca? I loved every page spent with Reese, Clay, and the wh...
      This is an absolutely beautiful story and you'll be mesmerized by the illustrations. Zagarenski has won two Caldecott Honors, so you know she knows what she's doing.
      WTF did I just read? I picked this book up based on a recommendation and I am glad I did. But, holy cow, it was insanely and weirdly twisted. Ryan is one majorly messed up guy. Abused by his father, emotionally and psychologically, he has tried everything to be accepted by him. No such luck dude....
      <strong>Great read!</strong><br /><br />This was one of the better menage stories that I have read. I laughed, cried and was shocked! This was a very different story than the usual ones out there! Please take the time to read this one as I know that you will not be disappointed...
      <strong>Excellent</strong><br /><br />This book was good from the beginning to the end. I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend this book. I can't wait until part 2 comes out.
      Scott Hildreth never fails to deliver a good story. However, his books are more than just a story. They also teach. Unstoppable is no exception. Mike Ripp Ripton is a bad dude. He is a tough alpha male that loves to fight, ride, and have sex. He didn't care if it was for the benefit of the woman,...

      I got something in my eye reading Unleashed. Scott Hildreth took me on quite the ride with this book. I don't think I have ever had so many feels reading a book before. I watched Michael "Ripp" Ripton's character transform in this book. It was beautiful, poignant, and heartbreaking all at the sam...

      As a librarian, I’m naturally a bit obsessed with reference books, and in particular, horror reference books.

      Beautiful. Heart breaking.<br />
      <strong>Loved this story! </strong><br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. Loved everything about it except it was too short! Hinted at something with Mattie's mother and dads story but never answered the question ...what happened. I would still highly recommend this story!
      This is a perfect first issue. What a set-up! What action?! A wonderful example of all the right ways to use panels and pictures to craft a story.
      This lovely read was so immensely engaging I finished it in one day! I love the characters in this novel and how they grow and how it all comes together in the end. Though this is mainly a romance, I enjoyed that in such a short novel the author managed to create believable characters with depth...

      The setting for this dystopian novel is atop a mountain to escape from the Threat Below, creatures their ancestors fled from 300 years earlier.

      Super cute. But why do girls have to be so mean to each other in kids' books these days? Am I just old?
      I liked it.The babys are soooooooooooo cute!!
      Sam and his friends defend the town of Biddlecombe from the Shadows. The plot has humor similar to Duglas Adams. The entire series is dark and slightly snarky style of wit and fun.
      Impresionante, con muchos toques excepcionales y humorísticos.
      <strong>Loved it</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, yes there was some mistakes not caught when proof reading. I simply brushed it right off, for a first time author great job!!! I look forward to hopefully a book 2

      Started reading this story as the author is in a group I am in on facebook. Fell in love with Cooper and Nadira. I like how the story progressed and would recommend this to anyone who likes vampire romance novels.

      Loved it. Great read!
      Finally. <br /><br />I've been searching for this book for 15 years.
      I read John Haywood's Nonfiction book Viking the Norse warrior's manual. This book tells you how to be a good Viking warrior by telling how to act at feast where to sit and what good qualities to look for in your warband leader. The book tells you how Viking men and children train. People who are...
      Different than what I had expected. I enjoyed it, a different twist than a shifter type paranormal romance.
      ***** ANOTHER WINNER!<br /><br />The fourth book in the Rolling Thunder Series, “Gunnin’ For You,” starts out with a bang––sexually, and as it turns out, metaphorically as well. It’s a great portrayal of a man’s discomfort with empty sex and his unconscious need for something deeper. And what that scene does...
      that wonderful combination of a window into deeply personal emotions yet inviting enough to allow universal enrichment. <br /><br />sensitive to emotions of glancing.
      <strong>The suspense increases!</strong><br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Colleen Coble, and have read nearly all of her books. This latest one is more suspenseful than ever. I was guessing all through the storyline and had several surprises at the end. Delightful characters, with secrets of their past, but overcoming those obst...

      Good read. Blushing
      Hello test review!
      <strong>Pretty good</strong><br /><br />My only complaint is too many characters! So confusing and hard to keep track. Good story line , a little slow in the middle. Overall a good read.

      <strong>Damn!</strong><br /><br />Syn had a ruff life and didn't know how to handle when someone cared for her other then her girls!!! Please let Parker find her!! A must read!!!
      Reminds me of Mo Willems style. Very amusing, very clever and very entertaining. Much better book than other books on list on friendship. This celebrates the differences you may have with your buddy. The text is still simple enough for early readers. Top pick!
      I love the way everyone that Madlenka meets sees a different dog at the end of her leash. His drawings of the different breeds is right on.
      I was disappointed that Czechoslovakia was not included in Madlenka's trip around the world of New York because after all Peter Sis is from there!
      Soooo interesting! I love these case studies.
      This is not my preferred reading, but this is a well constructed, well written book. You can understand the emotions of the characters and the sad, poignant moments are well written, tissues required! Well worth reading, and it feels like a very long book.
      <strong>Red Rising</strong><br /><br />It was initially somewhat slow but manages to pick up in the middle and then comes up with a very satisfactory ending..

      Reinvention, travel, second person narrative. Interesting book.
      I really liked the protagonists in this one. I wish it hadn't ended with them trying to live in two places at once (especially because visiting her house puts him in danger every time), but other than that it was a very good story.
      This was an incredible book. It flowed so seamlessly that if it hadn’t been for the author’s name on the chapter, you would think it was written by one author instead of such a large group. Each author definitely left their mark on Verity and Hudson. Verity is hilarious. Her first impression of H...
      This is book 2 in the Moonbound series, it picks up about where book 1 ended. Aria is missing her best friend Reyna who found her mate at the end of book 1. She is also feeling a little out of the loop as Reyna's father seems to have replaced her as one of his enforcers for the meeting about Elis...
      Wow! I think I've found a new favorite author.Thank goodness she has written fifty novels. That ought to keep me busy for awhile.<br /><br />Darkness starts with an airplane slamming into the side of a mountain and the action continues for the entire story. Cal has an idea what is going on, but Gina has no c...
      Non-fiction writers, pay attention to this book: Daniel James Brown is a wonderfully gifted true storyteller!

Together they bond over their off-kilter mothers, giggle about prudish Sister Scholasti...
      I like Christi Caldwell's books. I had read the other book in this series. I enjoyed Harry and Anne's love story. Two good characters.
      On the cusp of her first London season, Miss Madeline Gracechurch was shy, pretty, and talented with a drawing pencil, but hopelessly awkward with gentlemen. She was certain to be a dismal failure on the London marriage mart. So Maddie did what generations of shy, awkward young ladies have done:...
      One of the best books I've ever read. I wished for a different ending. Hopefully there will be a novella for closure.

      While I don't always agree with the late great Hitchens, he is a very entertaining true storyteller and a no-nonsense, old-school journalist.

      Really entertaining account of the 2008 meltdown. Wall Street makes me sad.
      "Passenger 19" by Ward Larsen was a pretty darn good yarn. I'm not usually a "plane down, go rescue" kind of girl, I tend to choose the more traditional mysteries. But this was a very tightly written mystery that had me wondering how the hero was going to win the day.<br /><br />Jammer Davis has been a pilot...
      This is currently Sawyer's (2.5) favorite book. He will read it while practicing sitting on the toilet. He pours over it looking for Goldbug on each page and when he and Daddy read it together they have fun trying to find Goldbug before the other does. <br /><br />It's a long book so usually we just read a f...
      simply awesome!
      A nice hilarious and refreshing read.
      A book for keepsakes... read it time and again...<br />One of the best i have ever read
      4.5 stars<br />"Golden” by Kathryn Robson was one of the most unexpectedly awesome books I’ve read in a looong time. To be totally honest, at first I wasn’t sure I’d like it because I had a hard time figuring out what it was about from the description, and I’ve been a bit burned out on paranormal latel...
      Written in 2004, Watson’s Dictionary of Weasel Words describes itself as “a serious weapon in the struggle against those whose words kill brain cells and sink hearts”. For those who know me even just a little, it should come as no great surprise that I was drawn to this book.<br /><br />So what are “weasel w...

      just can't wait for the next one. getting better with each book.
      A masterpiece of tragicomedy!
      <strong>Loved this book!</strong><br /><br />Great, fast read. Adventure at every turn. Lots of twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Mystery thriller that keeps your heartbeat up!!

      <strong>Maximum Exposure</strong><br /><br />Unexpectedly good plot and character development. I liked the storyline and the way it unfolded. Looking forward to the next book.
      <strong>Couldn't Put It Down</strong><br /><br />IOU was a well crafted story that kept me wanting to read on. Len's style was engaging from the very first sentence. One of those stories that stays with you. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great read with no slow spots.
      this book was amazing! One of my favorite books of the year so far. The writing was beautiful and thoughtfull. I was smiling like an idiot while reading this book. Henry Denton is such a deep charcter. His struggles with family and just life are relatable and inspiring. I highly recommend!
      <strong>The waters of life.</strong><br /><br />The young people of this story are true dreamers as I am sure a lot of us were or are. They were brought to life in this story.

      Profound
      I enjoyed this book and this series. The author built a detailed character of the heroine, and the others involved were well described as well. The locations of the story were clear and well-described.
      <strong>This book was just awesome.</strong><br /><br />This book book pulled so many emotions out of me and I couldn't put it down. The love between the two characters was beautiful. What a love story. I cried so much through this story. It was brilliant. A must read!!!
      Read it with my 6th grade kiddos and we all loved it.
      Soaked<br /><br />I gotta say I've been waiting for this to come out for what seems like forever; and it didn't disappoint! Stacy hit the nail on the head with this awesome romance. <br /><br />The strong characters are on point, sure Sadie seems a little stubborn at points but they're for good reason. West seems maybe...
      False Start by Julianna Marley is a first time read for me. Every chapter drew me in more than the previous . I wasn't sure what to expect in this story as I jumped into reading it with no knowledge of what it would be about. Julianna Marley did an amazing job not only writing this story, but als...
      This book was a little disappointing after book 1. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and I still recommend the duo, but it didn’t quite meet the standard I expected after Quin I. <br />The chemistry between Quinn and Lexi still explodes from the beginning of the book. And it only burns hotter. Until da...
      4.5 stars
      I read this quite a few years ago and really enjoyed it.
      <strong>Worth reading</strong><br /><br />The book was well written. Some parts were a bit annoying and I felt like shouting at Finlay because he didn't get it sometimes and with his background I expected him to be more aware. Having said that I had to read more and more as the chapters developed and had a few later nights t...
      Heartbreaking and powerful, yet hopeful as well, this is a book I'll never forget
      <strong>I love Jack Reacher</strong><br /><br />Fast paced, typical of Lee Child. Lots of interesting plot twists. Stayed up too late just to find out the ending.
      I'm official a Harry Potter fan! I loved this book it had a lot of twists and turns! But, oh no....the dark lord has return! Can't wait to read more! Onward to the fifth year! Happy Reading!
      Hanging Pawns is the second book in the Fate series. It's set before Adjournment (the first in the series) and is from Mea's point of view.<br /><br />When reading Adjournment I enjoyed Mea's character and wondered more about her story so it was great to read Hanging Pawns and learn Mea and Josh's story.<br /><br />Ther...

      The Worth The Fight series is one of my very favorites. I was thrilled to get this ARC. Travis "Texas" has been just lurking around in the background for 5 books, tipping his hat and loving to fight. His story was worth the wait. His evolution from single with never any ties, to deny any type of...
      The Three Pigs by David Wiesner is a fun twist on the classic book The Three Little Pigs. The book starts the same way as the classic but soon takes an unexpected turn when the pigs figure out how to get out of their story and into other classic children’s books leaving the big bad wolf confused...
      Wow! Ummm I'm speechless!<br /><br />Review coming soon
      Can't wait to see what volume 2 has in store cause I can imagine it only gets doper!
      Having not read any other books by the author, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I began “Sand and Blood”, but I found myself enjoying this fantasy coming of age story a great deal. Taking place in a desert setting, the book introduced me to Rutejìmo a youth who has not yet gone through his clan’...

      After being absorbed in George Friedman's book on predicting how the 21st century may unfold (See below "The Next 100 Years ...") it is a sobering read to see how Dan Gardner demonstrates that "experts" invariably miss the mark, and do it to an outrageous degree. Mr. Gardner offers the following...

      Cover:<br /><br />Die Ausarbeitung des Covers gefällt mir sehr gut, denn es zeigt in meinen Augen nicht nur ein Pärchen, vielmehr wirkt dieser Bildausschnitt für mich, wie ein Rückblick auf eine vergangene Zeit, die man zurück sehnt. Ebenso wirkt die Mimik der Frau und des Mannes sehnsuchtsvoll. In ihnen lie...
      Good Book
      I read several VC Andrews years ago. The were always well written and great stories. Make sure to read the entire series and in order.
      This riveting tale about a girl growing up in a Mormon society where women are supposed to stay at home and men are the ones who have the control allows the reader a glimpse into what happens when a crime is committed and no one wants to take responsibility. Although Wives and Sisters is a fictio...
      this is my first by this author &amp; I can't say enough good things...captivating...could not put it down!
      I enjoyed this second book by Adam Gopnik. There were a few parts that dragged, but for the most part it was comical and portrayed an accurate and interesting description of life in NYC.
      The Danger in Bohemia is a first time reading author H.E. Kollef for me, and the book was excellent. Ms. Kollef created an absolutely suspenseful, dangerous, adventurous and romantic tale that takes place in Prague. In her Author Bio it’s written, “Her favorite city is Prague and she recommends i...
      Great story.. Looking forward to reading more from this author
      I loved this book. It was so cute. Some of the things the boys do to her are embarassing/awful and the crap she has to put up with in dealing with Evan's girlfriend is horrible. It was such a fast read; I couldn't put it down.
      We all know that the best part of life comes AFTER the HEA. I loved that this book was all about making a relationship work- not just meeting your dream partner. Malcolm is so used to setting a goal, and working his way towards it, that he is becoming a workaholic. Kylie is so afraid of becoming...
      <strong>Growing in best intentions</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It wasn't over-syrupy. The characters were relatable and the sadness and suspension in Daphne's life moved forward without being "perfect." I think that there is a lot of truth in the sentiments, frustration and bitterness that the characters had. Th...
      This second book in the Wings of War series, is just as entertaining and compelling as the first. Fortunately, I already had books one and two so I continued reading without stopping. <br /><br />Last night when I finished book two, I immediately downloaded book three. This series is amazing and extremely ha...
      <strong>Hernandez Does It Again</strong><br /><br />I love the creepiliciousness of Hernandez's mind. This is another spine- tingling collection that you're sure to love. So get your copy and savor these tasty morsels. You won't be disappointed.
      I liked this book better than the first, I think there was more action and happiness.
      Paula is a 35 year old fiercely independent divorce lawyer. She was raised by a free spirited young storyteller mother, Kai, who reinvented their history as they roamed from place to place.

      Amazing book. I keep rereading it, and it brings me to tears each time.
      Loved every bit of it. Turns out JK Rowling can do adult fiction just as well as the harry potter series.
      I really enjoyed this book, Cade always seemed to me bland and boring but ended up being funny and passionate. I loved this romance!
      <strong>Excellent</strong><br /><br />This book was good from the beginning to the end. I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend all three books and can't wait until the 4th one comes out.
      Absolutely loved this book - - starts nearly on V-J day, WWII and tells a fascinating and heart breaking (at times) story that weaves the lives of 3 different women and a man......and a little baby girl. I believe the book is newly released just this year. Should be destined for good reviews!

      ENEMY’S ENEMY by Jan Guillou reads like a classic John Le Carré spy thriller instead of the lightweight, flash-and-dazzle escapism of Fleming or Ludlum. The emphasis is on the real, down-and-dirty, nitty gritty assignments of field operative Carl Hamilton. A man who will go to any lengths in the...

      I bought the paperback just to have it. It was expensive as hell, but I loved this story so much that it was worth it.
      Wonderful
      <strong>Four short enchanting mysteries. </strong><br /><br />I have found Melanie Jackson just recently and I must say I enjoy her work tremendously. These four stories only make you want more.
      Awesome. As good as the others. This story is a out Emma and Julian and it kind of makes my heart hurt at the end.
      It took me a little while to get into this book, but I'm glad I stuck with it. An interesting blend of fantasy and history. Well worth a look.
      Maybe I just wasn't in a reading mood, but it took me a while to get into this book. But once I did I found it very interesting. Hard to read about life in France during WWII, but we must be aware and not forget.
      <strong>Great book</strong><br /><br />I loved everything about this book I really need to read the rest of the books from this one such a good page turner
      Wonderful story.
      Great for young kids! Teaches emotions, even though only the word "moo" is used.
      Really enjoyed this.
      This was a unique book about some of the struggles and worries kids have while going through tough times. I know some of my students have to deal with crappy home lives and things that are out of their control. I think a lot of them could relate to this book. It deals with these issues in a posit...
      read it to baby Elizabeth cute book :D

      I have never read anything by Christi Caldwell before, but I enjoyed this story. The premise being that the hero and heroine have been betrothed since childhood.

      SUCH an important book. Brilliant, honest, poignant.
      Loved the end of the series. What a good story!
      MY MOST FAVOURITE NOVEL.<br />Ini novel keren banget sumpah. Cinta. pertemanan, drama, sekolah, konflik semuanya campur jadi satu. 4 thumbs for Elizabeth Eulberg
      LOVE The story...
      This is the book that talks about the aftermath - after the victory has been won, there's a giant mess to clean up. Another fun page turner from Cashore.
      This was a breath of fresh air. Huck is great and super endearing and sweet. Also, the art is fantastic
      A good brain workout for kids.
      <strong>SOUL TINGLING </strong><br /><br />Fool Me Once is a mystery that can be hard to follow (purposely). It's a who done it that I could not predict the outcome; many twists. My heart went out to Maya, the main character, as she searched for several killers. I always enjoy Coban's novels and this was no exception.
      One of my favorite books of the past decade. Atkinson is incredible. Her ability to weave several stories awes me.
      Great book! I love dystopia, so this was a perfect book for me
      Wow! By the fourth book in the series I thought I would be tired of it, but oh, no! It got better. Thoroughly enjoyed the hero and heroine. The twist with him being "cursed" was new for the plot (at least for me). I also enjoyed that Prudence and her mother reconciled. The Duke of Thornbridge was...
      Adventure...fun read
      3.5 A pretty quick read. I liked how the author went back and forth between present day &amp; the past with things slowly coming together. Plenty of good themes for a good book club discussion.
      good book. loosely based on biblical story. Enjoyed much. Highly recommend, good story line, lots of twists/action, little strange/comfortable beginning
      I'm a fan of everything Brandon Mull writes and recently started on the Five Kingdoms series. His books are full of humor (especially teenage comebacks), tension, and interesting plots. I liked Fablehaven better than this, but this was better than Beyonders in my opinion. The story is about some...
      A great read. The premise of the book is pretty humorous. Looking forward to watching the 1959 movie.
      ** ARC PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR FOR AN HONEST REVIEW ** <br /><br />OK first of all I have to say I'm in love. Elizabeth Brown is a gifted writer. This book was very well written. And can easily be a favorite. When reading feels like it's speaking directly to you. It has everything a book lover could want it's...
      Like an eight year old, I find books about underwear hilarious. The deal was sealed for my library to order our own copy when my children's programmer borrowed it from another library and read it at story time -- to hear a group of children yell "Underwear" in the library is pretty hysterical.
      I very much enjoyed this one more over the 1st book. I was drenched in reading this one from the moment i picked it up.
      Great book if you want to know your personality type and then be blown away when you realize some of the motivations behind the things you do. But the importance of this book is when it is used as a tool for personal growth.
      <strong>Obedience at its best</strong><br /><br />I am in love with this book. Halfway through I bought a copy for a friend and have recommended to numerous people. This book has opened my eyes tremendously and brought me closer to God than ever before. I'm beyond blessed to have been given the opportunity to read and study...
      <strong>Cool</strong><br /><br />Love the second part this this book I like the fact that it's gone to the mans point of view on what he's been doing . I also like the fact that they explained his back history.
      My favorite of his thus far
      Kids loved it. Rhyming and rhythm were great.
      It was a quick read
      <strong>Really good book! </strong><br /><br />Although this book is not the usual genre that I prefer, it was a really good book. It was action packed and unpredictable from beginning to end. I couldn't stop with just Wrecked, I HAD to read Reckless too. I became so invested in the story with part one that there was no way...
      Strong possibility that the caregivers liked this more than the kids, but it kept the kid's attention and offered a lot of opportunities for interaction.
      Neurotic Quentin is a god!
      I read this book overnight, it was so good! It was full of surprises and this author is just the best!
      So cute.. so sad
      Kids LOVED this book. Kept attention during PreK Story time.
      While covering the topic thoroughly and relaying the information in an accessible manner, Vasoli had to temper her dialogue with caution. There is no solid evidence that the letter was dictated by Anne (it not being in her handwriting is clearly proven) and any reputable historian should acknowle...

      The whole novel so good but the ending not as wrapped up as I'd hoped.
      I wanted to write this review last night, right after I finished this book.<br /><br />But I couldn't.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I was too busy laughing. LOL.<br /><br />I loved this. <br /><br />Omg, seriously, Alexa Riley, why do you so get me? <br /><br />I think imma go buy it now. <br />
      If you are looking for inspiration and encouragement to help you in your walk with God as the years unfold then this book meets the bill.

      My new favorite Founding Father
      <strong>Hartness just keeps getting better</strong><br /><br />John's best writing to date. Why Hollywood or the networks haven't grabbed up his work is beyond me. The action is tight and well written, on par with anything Whedon ever did. His sub plots are Chandleresque without being too much of a ripoff. And while there is...
      interesting and quick, fun read
      <strong>Good Quick Read</strong><br /><br />This novella is a fun read on a snow day. People who enjoy Odd Thomas will enjoy this,<br /> pet lovers also.<br />

      This book, the third book in the Dido Kent series, is by far stronger than the first two. I almost gave up on the series, but now I am glad that I persevered.
      A lovely little epilogue to All You Need is Love, which was available to read on Marie Force's website. It showed Will and Cameron packing up her things in NY and we got to meet her father and friends a bit more.
      Title seemed silly and a few of the early conversations with secondary characters felt stilted, but other than that, it rocked. Hot and steamy!
      The Study of Seduction by Sabrina Jeffries was engaging book from the first chapter to the last. I enjoyed the banter between Edwin and Clarissa, it truly made the book great. I am new to Sabrina Jeffries and this book made me a fan. I liked how Edwin was able to share an interest with Clarissa t...
      So smart!! Jeez.
      <strong>Entertaining</strong><br /><br />Good storyline that kept me engaged the whole time. No slow parts. Can't wait to read the next one in the series!
      A wonderful book about LGQT culture in Athens :)<br /><br />But for real, this is an extraordinarily influential dialogue and gave me great insight into Socrates/Plato. Excited to read some more soon.
      This book's story and illustrations are so great. It really captures a young girl's passion for dance, as well as the hope that springs eternal for children with dreams of greatness.
      Great mystery................as only Agatha can do!
      <strong>First book by for me by this author</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed this book. I felt that at times it was too simplistic, juvenile may be? Will I buy the next book? Yes and I look forward to reading it
      One word. Troy. And where can I find me one?
      This wasn't at all what I was expecting but a really good book. The way the author captures the minds of children is amazing and while some parts don't seem particularly realistic I still found myself hooked. This was a nice book to read on a long train journey and isn't long and dragged out like...
      Slightly biased, of course, as I wrote it. But I do think you'll like it too.
      Perfect for starting to learn the rules for my driving theory test that is upcoming. The pages of road signs were particularly useful and I'll continue to use this to memorise them up until my theory test. The price of this is also very good considering how much it helps.
      Because clients are people like anyone else, success when working with clients is fundamentally based on putting their interest first. By demonstrating honesty, competence and caring, you can set your company apart from the competition, while creating support networks that will keep you afloat ev...
      Everyone should read this book. Then everyone should write to Congress about giving Snowden amnesty.
      Unlike the usual kind of books of 100 places you need to visit, this book is interesting to highlight the alternative: those you will never visit. Though some places were probably not that interesting and seemed to make up the 100, it's still worth a read!
      The voice felt so authentic and relatable!
      <br />This is a sweet story about Liz, a women trying to prove something to her father and trying to make her own way. Her father is rich and not remorseful and actually willing to hurt or kill people to get his own way, but Liz doesn't know the half of it. Yet.<br />Liz gets a job as a jockey, to ride a hor...
      This was a hilarious fast read for only 20p. I don't think it's worth it if you're paying full price because it really is very short. But there are a lot of funny passages and I'm sure the photos look a lot better when in colour and not on Kindle!
      One of the saddest things I've ever read.
      Really funny book to read and I think I prefer reading it now the identity of the author is known as it makes it feel a lot more real. Probably one of my favourite diary-style books that I've read in recent years and it's such a different book as well. Not many books are on this subject matter!
      I never get tired of seeing Excalibur.
      This is for older readers, but if you like mature comedy than this book is for you
      <strong>Amish Dreams</strong><br /><br />It is as if the next book is as good as the last one or it is more interesting because you relate to it....
      Always fun to read about where you live
      I loved the layout of this book. I haven't really been into the Vampire scene, but I'm one I won't knock until I try it and I'm so glad I did. Stefany kept me intrigued and wanting more.

      <strong>Definitely one to read!</strong><br /><br />Will keep you captivated The whole series! Couldn't put it down, love the characters and their story lines! Very hot and very steamy also, but with class!
      I guess a 3.5. There were moments of pure 5 and moments of a 2. Overall it was a good book putting this author on the radar for me. I would definitely read more of her work. So why a 3.5? Because Aspen was too good for her father and as strong as she is portrayed she continued to let her father v...
      I loved it!!!!!!
      A beautiful story. This is storytelling like it should be, vivid imagery, wonderful illustrations, and a story that fills your heart and your imagination as you read it. I totally fell in love with it.
      best thriller I think I ever read and I have read many. Lots of interesting twists and turns tha tyou were not suspecting. Be prepared for graphic violence though.
      I was given an ARC for an honest review. B. B. Hamel keeps getting better and better. This book captured and held on to me till the end. Everything flowed so smoothly from the war between the Russian and Italian mobs to Vince and Kaley. It was the perfect balance and of course the sex was raw and...
      Narrated by Mira, Harrison blends together: "Snow White" and "Beauty and the Beast" to create a unique fairytale that deals with the contentious relationship between sisters.<br />The theme also addresses forgiveness and the power of love over magic.
      This story is massive, galaxy spanning, and full of character moments and progression from the main cast as well as those around them. Most of the art is great, and as is always the case with Johns and Johns-related material, the dialog is possibly the highlight of the whole thing. That being sai...
      I had somehow missed the entire "war brides" part of history and it is fascinating.
      Fun story, artwork is amazing, I'm really digging this "new" Hulk who is constantly learning more about himself and his powers. Can't wait to see what happens in the next arc!
      I read this in Tamil. I still remember few events in the book. A warm afterglow remains after all these years.
      Nice to return to Grisham now and again to read a thriller that's not constantly kickin' ass and spewing guts all over the sidewalk. The last third of the book is a bit anti-climatic and the biggest surprise is what didn't happen. Hah! no spoiler for you.<br />
      Gripping and suspenseful. Is it too late for me to get my review on the cover? It is? Oh well.
      beautiful book!!!
      Pretty good, and a must read for Pittsburghers because knowing all the landmarks makes it more fun to read.
      Wicked Weapon is the next highly anticipated book in the Dark Hearts Series by Cari Silverwood.If you thought Wicked Ways was dark you haven't read anything yet!<br />I don't want to say much in this review in case I spoil it but you can guarantee that this book will leave you in a book funk for days a...
      I finished this book over a month ago and I cannot stop thinking about Robert Peace.
      Just a few chapters in and I am already pulled in by the excellent storytelling...
      Great teen voice; fast read.
      As Pride &amp; Prejudice is one of my favorite books, I love anything to do with that story and have read many not as enjoyable "continuing" stories of the Bennett sisters. This one however was very enjoyable and tells the story of the "downstairs" help that keep the Bennett manor running smoothl...

She suffers from debilitating migraines as she tries to remember the events before she woke up on that beach half-naked. What she does remember is her close friendship with her cousins...
      Highly compelling narrative nonfiction. The author weaves a beautiful tapestry with the compelling stories of unique individuals coming together physically and emotionally as a team that, despite overwhelming odds, beat the German home team in eight-man crew at the Nazi Olympics in 1936. The best...
      Interesting information. I knew that many Nazi's had come to America after World War II, however I thought it was only those who had been minor officials or desk workers, cogs, not high level slaughteres. I'm glad I know the truth.
      Loved this blend of fantasy and folklore.
      <br />Received a copy for an honest review.<br />Two people completely different and yet work perfectly together. There is a thin line between love and hate. There was no love loss in high school but as the approach a new working relationship the chemistry builds. Fun story that I really enjoyed.
      Funny quotes which suit me perfectly! Definitely have a couple of favourites but don't want to reveal them here. So far this is my favourite of this series, although I haven't read a complete version of any of the others.
      While not as good as The Hunger Games this still has a good plot line and the characters are still as strong as before. The reason why I didn't give it five stars is because the ending seemed really rushed. 20 pages from the end should easily have been 100 pages from the end but I hope the third...
      Loved this Book! Love Leanne's writing. It was a great opener to the series and I enjoyed greatly!
      Loved The Outsiders and the Brat Pack, so I found this to be really interesting. Definitely a few surprises, too. Plus, I was hearing the voice of his Parks &amp; Rec character the entire time I read it!
      <strong>Excellent spy story</strong><br /><br />I really liked it. Well written and compelling characters and story line. Lots of action yet kept believable. And realistic.
      Much better than Twilight. Read this in less than four hours, so much better than expected and now can't wait to see the film and read the sequels!
      Kaunis kirja niin ulkoa kuin sisältä. Täynnä taikaa!
      Fantastic.
      I really liked the story because it had believable characters, plot twists and quick pace. However, I felt like I was slogging through wet cement at the end. I had to push through, but enjoyed the book overall.
      I enjoyed the nuggets of information about elephants. I hope it's factual.
      A mixture of story, anthropological examination, and myth, this story is a tale of a sect of religious women with the ability to call forth a dark twin from the shadows. Students in the group are sent on a mission before becoming full-fledged members. It is on this mission that two young girls be...
      Although a little slow starting, this is one of the rare books that I couldn't put down once I did get through those first initial chapters. Finally a serial killer that makes really obvious mistakes! This made it a compelling read and the medical descriptions were all really fascinating and accu...
      Very nice world building.
      Charming series and so amusing. Can't wait to read the rest

      Fairy Tales have been around for centuries and reflect the tradition of oral history; stories spoken from one person’s memory to another. This is why some Fairy Tales seem to be subtle differences depending where you were brought up. Did you hear that the three little pigs boiled the wolf alive,...
      10 stars
      <strong>Orchids and Stones</strong><br /><br />This was such a great read. It had romance and suspense all built into one story. If you like reading these kinds of stories, please take the time to read this story.
      A TL;DR of 'The Odyssey' (which I read in Year 12). This is feminist retelling of a classic story done right (during Year 12, we also read Carol Ann Duffy's 'The World's Wife', similar concept, which I was not keen on at all).
      <strong>Prepper's Crucible vol5</strong><br /><br /> This it's the volume I couldn't put down and it's not til the last sentence in the book for it gives you any indication of the cliffhanger from volume 3. I am looking forward to the final volume just to hear the story of what happened to Don.
      I used to have to type up and edit obits for a small daily paper. I still have a weird attraction to reading obits, even of people I don't know. I liked knowing I'm not the only person who has an interest, or even obsession, with them.

      Always love Knuffle Bunny
      <strong>Historical &amp; poignant</strong><br /><br />I really enjoyed reading the story about this rowing team. The history given and the struggles that Joe Rantz lived through are heartbreaking and inspiring. Reading about the intricacies of Germany and all that they went through to disguise Hitler's regime and what was re...
      It's a slow burn but well worth it by the end. Wow, that ending!
      <strong>LOVE THIS BOOK</strong><br /><br />Love this series. The adventure and mystery of the story keep me wanting more.Can't wait to read what happens next.
      Thrilled that the author wrote this book about spinning faux-postivie into everything and anyone. Please get out of denial and grab a healthy dose of reality because it is important to see things for what they are. Sincere thank you to the author.
      <strong>Out of the park</strong><br /><br />Marie James did it again. I fell in love with Kincaid right from the start. The story is very believable as a few biker clubs are family like this one. Pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.
      This book has some good useful tips. I like that there was some very practical steps to follow. The idea of buckets is a great idea - much more organized then what I currently have. She shares a lot about social media and which one(s) might be your best options as an author. There was also some g...
      Many great moments occasionally ruined by long, irrelevant digressions about magic. Some careless POV shifts. Some memorable characters and scenes.

      4.5 rating. love this author -- a must read.
      Loved how Genie didn't let her honeymoon go to waste especially after what Ross did to her loved how Donnie took his mom's advice and asked her out. Great love story.
      Such a beautiful book. So hard to read though. Called up some pretty horrific events in history with the Rwandan genocide. Favorite quote that induced some deep thoughts about forgiveness and Christ. <br /><br />"Something must have been looking out for Deo, and I disliked hearing the words in my mind. I sai...
      An amazing book about the lives if immigrants and what they go through. Loved that it was written in verse
      excellent read. An overview of life---look into the life of a husband and a wife through each setsof eyes. More feedback from the people who grew up in this town ----- uncomfortable, amusing and straightforward ----- llife.
       Los Hollister es la serie de libros que me inició definitivamente en la lectura. Recuerdo haber leído el primero y, con todo el dinero que había ahorrado por mi primera comunión y en todos los años anteriores, ir a por los 32 restantes, que costaban 600 pelas cada uno. Los compré todos en la fer...
      Who knew so much went on in a senior home? What fun to follow Ida’s account of Mrs. Kaplan’s adventures as they try to figure out if Vera Gold – not the most pleasant person – was murdered. It’s an enjoyable twist to Dr. Watson and Holmes.
      You will laugh, you will cry and you will think about the intensity of love. Wonderful story.
      The five wacky Wing Wing brothers, Willy, Woody, Walter, Wilmer and Wendell take young readers through math exercises in the form of circus-like acts. They juggle plates and pies and hide in a wooden box via a series of activities designed to get youngsters interested and to understand addition a...
      I found this book gripping and interesting- the plot is definitely very unique! I was expecting more murders throughout the story but there was a one hundred page gap in the middle which was a bit disappointing, I felt like the second half was rushed due to this. The ending also didn't make much...
      After falling in love with her middle grade sci-fi/fantasy Black Lightning, I knew without a doubt that K.S. Jones could write exceptionally well. So when I learned that her debut novel Shadow of the Hawk had taken first place in the Chawcer Awards for historical fiction and had won a literary cl...
      I really enjoyed this, definitely my favourite book written by Philippa Gregory (of the ones I've read). The BBC adaptation of the Cousins' War series stayed very faithful to the books. Definitely one to read if you're interested in this period of history.
      I received this book for free in return for an honest review. Penelope is being attacked by two dragon shifters when she first meets Alec, the hot, powerful biker dragon. As a vampire, she would have had the strength to fight them had they attacked her at night-time, but lucky for her Alec turns...
      <strong>Good </strong><br /><br />Dark story, good character development, new to some of the villains in the story. Makes you question what's really going on.
      A most unusual book. Who would believe that a girl, desperate for normal (her parents are into obsessive topiary and tiara-making) would find her unique happiness by being adopted by a baby Norwegian glacier named Cecil. The narration, coupled with beautiful, albeit a tad odd, illustrations, work...
      I am not sure what to say about this book, except it’s weird. The plot is weird, the characters are weird, their relationships with each other are the weirdest thing of all … but it is a really fascinating read exactly because of its weirdness.
      Echoing other reviews I've seen this hasn't been my favourite of the series so far. I understand the need to split up A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons due to length but I don't like how it was done- it feels like all of the least interesting characters have been lumped into one book, wi...
      WOW! Couldn't put it down
      This book was well-organized and informative. It contained great pictures and was easy-to-read, even for someone not really into cars.
      Watchmen is one of the most iconic graphic-novels for a reason. It features memorable characters, a unique story, and some food for thought as well. Comics don’t get much better than this.<br /><br />While I enjoy comics as much as the next guy, they are starting to get kind of formulaic. The villain has sim...
      Oh, FINALLY! I'm so glad all that's done. I think this would have been a great place to end it, but what do I know? Two more at least, so on to the next one!

      One of my favorite books!
      I'll have to read this many more times in order to fully understand it, but the first read through was still great.
      Loved this second book in the series. I find Minnie so sweet and refreshing, and LOVE the way she interacts with Eddie. I won't give the story away, but just love how upbeat and positive Minnie always tries to be. There's a real honesty about these books. Can't wait to read #3!
      Enjoyed this one
      “Change of Plans” is an incredibly touching, sad, yet inspiring story of a young woman fighting a terminal illness, and in her selflessness trying to do the last good deed for the sake of her husband and family – find them a new wife and a mother. Genna’s courage in the story was indeed worth adm...
      Loved this book! Difficult to put down, sometimes a bit slow and on occasion I wanted to slap some common sence into the main character, written beautifully though.
      Virkelig fin og smuk fortælling med en masse fantastisk på hjerte
      Awwww! Thank you, Raina Telgemeier for bringing the BSC back to life in graphic novel form. Still as good a series as I remembered &lt;3
      They're simple little books, but they're such a great adventure. I read these when I was growing up and even now, reading it as someone who's almost 25, the world and the ideas floating around in the background are really fantastic. Like seriously, what other book can you name that puts a mermaid...

      I find the concept of letting the readers decide whether a character lives or dies quite a strange one but in this case I think it actually worked quite well. This graphic novel provides very interesting backgrounds for a couple of the Robins and I enjoyed reading about how not all of the Robins...
      This book is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The author's rich descriptions are so wonderful, I had to read them twice. I can relate to his sense of place and identity with the land, it is just terrific that he can capture the feeling so accurately with his chosen words.
      Love the book, great concept, great song, great at keeping the attention of a room full of toddlers.<br /><br />Cons: About three pages too long.
      A book that will have you on the edge of your seat and questioning how pointless your 'Natural' is.
      Harley Quinn is my all-time favourite Batman villain so I was very excited to receive this as a present. I enjoyed reading a book where she was the main character and I liked reading about her softer side and friendship with Ivy. Looking forward to reading volume two and I loved the artwork.
      This was a great read really enjoyed it
      <strong>Keeps you on edge</strong><br /><br />I had a hard time putting this one down. It kept me in suspense and guessing at all times. Although some parts seemed a little farfetched, it was still a good read.
      awesome!
      <strong>Whew! What a trip!</strong><br /><br />This is an informative, concise, delightful book. I loved learning some facts about this country by "visiting it". Great concept. Great illustrations and photos!<br />

      Simply opening Locomotive by Brain Floca is a real treat, the book is filled with illustrations, maps, different fonts, and labeled parts of trains. I think that a picture walk of this book, would interest most kids, even with the length. Due to the length of this book, I’m unsure of how I would...
      <strong>Wow!</strong><br /><br />If you are going to read any book this year, let it be this one. I could only put it down when I was driving. What an inspirational story of a family with so many strikes against them! But, God is good (all the time!) G. Eric Francis takes you right into the everyday life of being with Noah....

      Legal novel - Nate O'Riley travels to the backcountry of Brazil to locate the illegitimate, missionary daughter of a multi-billionaire who commits suicide after leaving her his fortune and disinheriting his six legitimate children.
      This book is exquisite. It is not the same as the film of the same name, which lacks something in the directorship (acting is stunning).

      Oscar Wilde had intrigued my interest in his plays when I read “The Importance of Being Earnest.” It was so funny and such a good read that I decided to choose, “An Ideal Husband,” for this outside reading round. Although it is not as comedic as the other one, “An Ideal Husband,” was no disappoin...
      A solid work of history exploring the people and movements which resulted in the creation of Wonder Woman.
      I enjoyed this book, though selfishly wished there was more of Oregon and less California. Although I couldn't relate to many of Strayed's life experiences, I can relate to the heart of the reason for her journey. I'm not sure I would ever be able to do the journey, but it sure sounds like it mig...
      This is a beautifully written and touching story of tragedy and redemption. As with Rigby's other novels, the child's eye is used perfectly to draw us into family life and all it's flaws, using Leila, the daughter of wealthy Iranian Hassan, as the main narrator. The story does jump back and forth...
      This was an adorable story of a little girl sent to spend the summer with her grandfather while her parents deal with substance abuse issues with her older brother. Wonderfully handled and appropriate for 9+.
      Sheer enjoyment, another great story by Lianne Moriarty who seems to be able to craft every character so perfectly that you see some of yourself in them all, perfectly rounded ending.
      When ethics and heat collide, will someone get burned in the name of love? I am really becoming a fan of Ms. Lane. Her stories are more than just sensual reads. They are heartfelt expressions of the merry-go-round that is love. Through her writing she examines the euphoria and the pitfalls of thi...
      What a fascinating story and beautifully illustrated about a Czech folk hero that I bet not many people (including me) have heard about.
      <strong>Clear and concise</strong><br /><br />It has really down to earth simple techniques to make the Loa successful. Students of the loa will love it.
      There are no words for this story. Beyond my expectations, is all I have to say. This book delves to the bondage world. It's steamy, hot and a page turner. Nick Colton is my new book boyfriend. His journey through this book is wild and fantasy fulfilling. A worthwhile read of any book lover.

      <strong>A moving and compelling story of family and relationships!</strong><br /><br />A story full of the stages of grief when you have to face the loss of a loved one. The plot successfully left you with a feeling of hope.
      I didn't like the Harry Potter books (that is, the ones I managed to finish) so this book by J. K. Rowling really surprised me. It definitely deserves all the hype, it had me hooked from start to finish and for once I didn't guess the ending in advance. Fantastic characters, fantastic plot...I'll...

      I really liked this but did initially find it hard to keep up with all of the different characters.

      Even though I read this when much older than the average reader I still loved it. Much better than the film although some of the dialogue from all characters, not just the children, irritated me after a while. Definitely adding the Dark Materials number two to my reading list.

      One of the Guys by Shioh Walker is a super steamy story. Lots of sex, but there is also drama, romance, and excitement. For such a short story it sure does pack a lot into it. <br /><br />Jaynie catches her fiancé having a threesome with his best friend and a hot neighbor in their bed. She is humiliated, hur...

      Nicole and Reuben are a hot couple and it’s easy to sense their chemistry and physical attraction. The sex scenes are sensual and sizzling, making the reader downright envious of what they have. Nicole is easy to like, but even though Reuben is a hot guy who’s great in bed, you sort of wonder wha...
      I will forever love this book as I put it in the category of Anne of Green Gables. I recall my mom reading bits of this to me from her own personal copy, and though not outstandingly remarkable, the nostalgia makes it so.

      <strong>Pleasantly surprising</strong><br /><br />This is a nice story, very well written. This book kept me interested throughput . I would recommend reading the first book to the series.
      This is a very mixed bag. There's some crazy beauty, a fair amount of sexism, and a handful of duds. I liked it, though. <br />
      <strong>Nice</strong><br /><br />I enjoyed the whole re-telling. Each chapter switches between the main characters but I didn't find it bothersome or too repetitive. I was able to become invested in the characters. The prose was easy to read and it felt authentic.

      After seeing the move The Best Of Me, I knew I had to read the book. Surprisingly, there were many big difference between the two. At first it irritated me but then I was able to appreciate them separately. The book gives us insight into what the characters are thinking and feeling making it easi...
      Fucking brilliant!!! Could not put it down!!
      One of the better written of the genre; many interesting anecdotes - some humorous, some touching, some eye-opening, but all take the reader to the scene, and all have some sort of closure.
      Very unique book. Interesting concepts of travel through different dimensions.<br /><br />
      I thought this was a great mystery/thriller. Kept me guessing with a few twists and turns. I'm very claustrophobic and found it tough to read some of the detailed descriptions of Flora's captivity, but that speaks to the impressive and descriptive writing skills of the author.
      Judge and Austin are like dynamite when you get them in the same room.. This series is absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to read more.
      loved this book even though it's gotten a bit of slack! yes it is similar to other YA novels and has a LOT of tropes but it was just an enjoyable read that I sped through and always looked forward to reading!<br /><br />however, I was spoiled for the ending simply from everyone just hinting and talking about...
