If you get any book get this one . I bought it as a Birthday gift for myself and it was my best gift .
      So many great authors! So many who were also new to me. There was a wide range of different stories in here.

      I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review. I absolutely loved this story. Eddie Rochon decided another path than the family logging business. Eddie is a doctor and surgeon, he is incredibly talented but decided to return home to Apex to practice in his hometown and be close to his fami...
      This English Brothers boxed set includes the first four full-length novels from Katy Regnery's Blueberry Lane series about Barrett, Fitz, Alex and Stratton. Prepare yourself to fall in love with these insanely handsome blond and blue-eyed English brothers! A fair warning: they are absolutely addi...
      The character development is fantastic. The character of Colton is more than just words on a page, he become real the more you read. He is accused of murdering his wife, and his child is rendered literally speechless after his mother's brutal death. This story is a prime example of presumed guilt...
      Five stars for the pictures alone. The whole thing is surreal and evocative. A child's bigger-than-life imagination. So large even dreams can't hold it.
      I don't normally enjoy young adult books, but this trilogy one kept catching my attention, and I finally caved in and purchased he 3 books. Iam so glad Idid! Ireally enjoyed this first book. This was probably the best book Ihave read in a long while, and deffinitely the best young adult book I ha...
      <strong>Enticing Read</strong><br /><br />Well written story line with complex likable characters. Plenty of steamy sex scenes with a generous helping of action. This story is well worth the read!
      favorite of the series
      I thoroughly enjoyed this journal. I like that the author added the reasons for keeping this journal and the benefits of writing, I also love the inspirational quotes at the end of the book, that encourage people to think and write about what the motivations mean to them, For me, keeping a journa...
      <strong>Fun and cute</strong><br /><br />I love how the book started. You got to know the key players and love them. Even when the truth comes out. All and all it was a cute short story.
      fave!
      J'ai rencontré Célina sur booknode grâce à mon roman qu'elle avait adoré et c'est à ce moment-là qu'elle m'a demandé des conseils pour la publication du sien. Après plusieurs échanges nous avons rapidement sympathisé. Je l'ai ensuite intégrée à mon équipe, comme vous le savez, et présentée à L.S....

      .... lot to take in....
      A prisoner ends up taking on the identity of an army investigator and searches for a German spy.<br /><br />The basic story and characters were good, but in places the plot and writing were a bit laboured.<br /><br />Real rating 3.5
      <strong>Perfect Follow-up</strong><br /><br />Wonder what happens after graduation? Wonder no farther, thus book perfectly explains the next step in this wonderful story of Brie's journey through submission.
      <strong>Adventure series with unlikely heroes</strong><br /><br />A depressed journalist befriends a young PhD and the two begin an adventure steeped in history as dark as a pot of tea left on the stove for hours. Hard to put down, plenty of plot twists, and an excellent use of history blended with current events to make for...
      I think this will be my last Crombie for a while but I do like her plotting and characters. Just enough excitement to keep the reading interesting.
      Short, straight to her points, inspiring.
      One of the best books i've ever read in my whole life. Absolutely addictive. Once you start reading you can't stop till the last page.
      Very insightful.
      review coming
      Manda's 4 Star Review<br /><br />I love,love,love Bella Jewel!! This author consistently releases amazing books. I fell in love with the MC Sinners and have quickly found myself falling in love with the new generation. This book was really good and I read the entire thing in one sitting. I stayed up until th...
      THIS WAS SO GOOD. I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS WHEN I STARTED TO READ IT. I CAN'T BREATHE.
      July was born into slavery on a sugar-plantation. In old age, matriarch to the family of her free and prosperous son, she relates her personal story of Jamaica in the lead up to and early years of emancipation. By timely coincidence, I’ve finished reading this on the same day I’ve attended a talk...
      all about video games.
      "Always stand up for yourself."<br /><br />At a young age Rosa Parks was taught to not only respect others, but also respect herself. Respecting one's self is empowering. It is something that helped Rosa in standing her ground, and standing up for herself when she wasn't being treated fairly or with respect....
      This will give me nightmares. Amazing twist of the story.
      Great little story that isn't what it seems.
      well that was fantastic! I'm starting to like Celaena. it seems she's growing up. And the story... that ending! perfect.
      <strong>Amazing</strong><br /><br />I don't read this type of novel, but this one caught and held my attention. Amazing work. 10/10 would read again. Excited to finish the series!!!
      Galfard's stated aim is not to leave anyone behind and indeed, I could keep up until the start of the last section. First book of heavy cosmology that could take me that far. Call it Brief History of Time for Normal People.
      An enjoyable read, the story takes you on a journey into the world of folklore and myths.
      <strong>A book for anyone that hunts.</strong><br /><br />Something most hunters would dream about..but will never experience. (And may not want to!) And I thought driving to work was dangerous!
      "There's nothing foolish about dreaming big and being curious."<br /><br />Albert Einstein was a thinker. He was very smart and sometimes people wouldn't understand him or how he saw things. He saw the world a little bit different than we did. We was very smart. He wanted to know how the world worked. He nev...
      I received this ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review. <br /><br />What a fantastic story this is going to be a great series. Suspense, mystery and romance, it doesn't get any better. Loved this book.
      <strong>Please tell me you are writing books for Beckett and Jax's and when can we read them?</strong><br /><br />Finally a book with an actual story plot. Tired of reading the same old millionaire saves poor girl routine? This is the book for you! A story about love and life issues. A book to get lost in as you laugh along...
      Super report of an abused child who grew into an abusive, murdering g, raping adult. Put to death for his crimes in 1985, about 40 years too late.
      Most books are rated related to their usefulness and contributions to my research.<br />Overall, a good book for the researcher and enthusiast.<br />Read for personal research<br />- found this book's contents helpful and inspiring - number rating relates to the book's contribution to my needs.<br />
      It comes as no surprise that Julia Donaldson, Author of The Grufflo, is an incredible Children's book writer. She has absolutely done it again with The Snail and the Whale (Ok, Ok it was 10 years ago, but it's new to me!). The creativity and originality burst through on every page with every twis...
      Another great one by Joseph Boyden...though I liked Into Black Spruce a little bit more.
      Que esta antología sirva para reconciliarse con la literatura (porque nunca es suficiente).
      Fearless Beans is about a small white dog who gathers up bravery for every adventure that comes his way. The phrase “really, really ready” is repeated throughout which could be fun to use as a theatrical point when reading the story out loud.<br /><br />I imagine a 3-5 year old would like hearing this story...

      Once again MS Parker you have written an amazing book and whats better was that we got to read it one book after another, the cliff hangers were still the same but it was seconds later when relief was granted.<br /><br />Dena just wants what all her friends have, a good job and hot man that loves her with al...
      I started the book on wattpad. I really didn't expect it to be sooooo damn good I knocked senseless  totally a must read
      It was a great thriller and I didn't suspect the true evil until it practically was in front of me, the story was interesting and kept me thinking about all the possible suspects. Looking firearm to trying the next in this series!
      <strong>Loved it</strong><br /><br />Lani, you did again! Awesome story, easy to relate to....felt like you took me on a journey of my own life lol
      great descriptions, a nice change with an interesting set of circumstances
      great read
      This is pretty cute. If you're expecting Shakespeare, read Shakespeare. This is good for what it is.
      3.75 stars
      wow.
      it was interesting
      Return to Me is such a sweet but great read. The type of book that makes you wish to be part of this fairy-tale story. The type that most women wish to be swept off their feet by a charming and beautiful man in real life.<br /><br />When is meant to be, love will always conquer. No matter what the circumstan...
      Fun book, love the drawings and reading about food is always nice!
      <strong>I loved it.</strong><br /><br />Didn't realize I had already read this book until I started it. It was part of an anthology. I can't wait for chance to come out. I love this series
      Amazing. Will transform your view on money. I've read rich dad, poor dad and this is actually practical. You can put this book down and put it into action immediately.

Right? What could be farther from the truth!!!!!! <br /><br />Chris Keniston has done it again, Book# 2 of the Honeymoon s...
      I had just a bit of a hard time getting into the story line of this book. It starts out with the death of Karlinah's husband. You know that she has a secret about what has happened to him, but it takes quite a while in the book to actually learn what happened to him. <br /><br />Karlinah doesn't want to stay...
      This story is an interesting twist on two people renewing their love affair after many years of separation. Most of the book is the back story – how Jen and Phil spent their lives after breaking up when they were young – and when they meet after 20 years and the ending of other relationships, the...
      There's plenty of pressure for teens to have sex and many give in. When a romantic evening between Val Jensen and her boyfriend Zach turns into a breakup because he can't accept her decision to remain a virgin until marriage, little does she know how widespread the effects will be. It begins with...
      Sweet, enjoyable. A nice read. Not amazing, but I would recommend it.
      Loved this book!
      A wonderful introduction for children to the world of microbes, good and bad. A great addition to the elementary school library!
      I sincerely hope there is more to this branch of the Outlander story! I love these two characters.
      I picked up the book because of it was labelled 'spiritual horror' and it certainly delivers on that front. It's an intriguing and fascinating story that is frightening and clever. After another split from her boyfriend Shane, Jael moves away and via the Internet gets involved with Mike. Soon her...
      Lots of NJ attitude while a divorced mom tries to renovate a guesthouse for income. She discovers two ghosts on the premises who want her to discover their murderer. Soon she starts receiving threats on her life from unknown sources.
      Beautiful.
      <strong>Another Spectacular Yarros story</strong><br /><br />What wasn't to like? The characters and backgrounds were so rich and full. Bash and Emmy were an amazing couple with their own flaws. They worked through it all and built something bigger than themselves. For a novella, the story was deep and the emotions were raw....
      Great book. Loved every page. Never saw the ending coming.
      Love Todd Parr, as always!

      The Scottish Outlaws is a great series. Quinn, book two, can be read alone, but is better after reading book one, Jack. <br />Quinn not only rescues Lady Catarina, but finds love. Quinn and Catarina's characters are well written and likable. Lily Baldwin is doing an excellent job on the series. I will...
