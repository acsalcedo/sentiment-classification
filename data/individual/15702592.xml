  <description>Julie Barenson's young husband left her two unexpected gifts before he died: a Great Dane puppy named Singer and the promise that he would always be watching over her. Now, four years have passed. Still living in the small town of Swansboro, North Carolina, 29-year-old Julie is emotionally ready to make a commitment to someone again. But who? Should it be Richard Franklin, the handsome, sophisticated engineer who treats her like a queen? Or Mike Harris, the down-to-earth nice guy who was her husband's best friend? Choosing one of them should bring her more happiness than she's had in years. Instead, Julie is soon fighting for her life in a nightmare spawned by a chilling deception and jealousy so poisonous that it has become a murderous desire</description>

  <body><![CDATA[Woman, you need an intervention. Sparks is working his crazy hoodoo-voodoo on you again. Next thing you know you'll be reading his new book <em>The Botanist</em> about terminal cancer patient who kills her potted rubber tree plant and a jam jar full of sea monkeys, and then accidentally sets fire to an orphanage, a rain forest, and a puppy mill. You'd be better off reading those books about people taking dumps on each other's naughty bits that you like so much. (Doesn't Sparks write any of those?)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Anna...<br><br>That is one of the single most idiotic comments I've seen on Goodreads in quite a while. <br><br>1. People can 'get away' with calling other people unkind names because it's a free country. <br><br>2. If you're so easily and mortally wounded by a word -- a single word -- (not even directed at <em>you personally</em>) you have one hell of a tough road ahead of you, honey. It's best to go into your panic room right now and seal that bitch shut.<br><br>3. What does abortion have to do with anything here? While it's admittedly fun (and funny!) to talk about fetuses being burned alive, usually there's something that precedes it in a discussion to make it relevant. (See also 'Basic Interpersonal Communication 101.') You know, I could all of a sudden bring up the fact that I hate really dry bowel movements -- you know, the ones with a bunch of tiny fecal nuggets compacted together into one giant butt plug excretion -- and while it might be interesting, it would hardly be relevant.<br><br>4. Why is it that trolls always have private profiles? I love that. They throw stones from over their moats. Really brave. Let us troll through your drawers and see what you're about if you're going to inject yourself nonsensically into other people's review threads. Fair is fair.<br><br>5. Are you Jon Bruenning? You're too moronic not to be.<br><br>6. But you probably really are a bastard! That's the ironic thing here.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[See you hate in him for the fact he killed a dog but... What about "Old Yeller" every body loved that book and the boy killed his dog for having rabies and defending the little boys mother and sister from a wolf but in this book the dog is poisoned lives gets up and protects his owner and gets shot by the bad guy. This book was simply amazing and I think singer was a very brave dog who was doing his job defending his master. This book is really about the dog and masters relationship through good and bad not a love story. Even though the book is told like a love story and thriller it's truly about the dog as quoted in the titled of the book "The Guardian"]]></body>
