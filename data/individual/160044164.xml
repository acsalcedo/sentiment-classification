  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Nearly three years have passed since that tragic day in September. Since then, our wounds have healed, but our senses and memories have dulled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, the nation rallied behind its leader. But by the time the confrontation with Iraq presented itself, our courage and moral certainty seemed to fade in the face of partisan bickering and posturing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the political left and the Democratic Party are trying to use the demanding aftermath of the war to exploit our national cause for their own political advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How could we allow ourselves to forget so soon?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--from &lt;em&gt;Deliver Us from Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sean Hannity's first blockbuster book, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Let Freedom Ring&lt;/em&gt;, cemented his place as the freshest and most compelling conservative voice in the country. As the host of the phenomenally successful &lt;em&gt;Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes&lt;/em&gt; on the Fox News Channel and &lt;em&gt;The Sean Hannity Show&lt;/em&gt; on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in &lt;em&gt;Deliver Us from Evil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Evil exists," Hannity asserts. "It is real, and it means to harm us." And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless "multilateralism" when the times call for decisive action. For only through strong defense of our freedoms, at home and around the world, can we preserve America's security and liberty in the dangerous twenty-first century.</description>

      <![CDATA[Not the worst book ever written, but pretty fucking close.<br /><br />I must begin by saying that since Hannity is below a purely academic discussion, resorting to personal insults won't trouble my conscience at all.

  <body><![CDATA[I haven't read this yet but still plan to, in spite of your insightful review. For the same reason I read some of Sarah Palin's trash and a few others, I believe it's important to understand what is happening to my beloved country and how it's possible that Americans can so misunderstand what this once great nation really stands for. I cried the night Barack Obama was elected; I was trulyproud of my country in a way I had not been before. Unfortunately I have cried fir the last seven years as well - for a completely different reason but one no less important. And it's assholes like Hannity that have made it possible for an historic moment like that to bring out the worst in those that are normally too cowardly to express their bigotry and hatred by making his views seem "patriotic." He, Palin and others of their ilk have given licence to spew the worst publicly, feelings normally buried by shame and justified by nothing other than fear-mongering - the ugliest side of ill informed uneducated idiots who have no idea it's they who are destroying our democracy and ideals. i'm not surprised by your review yet feel drawn ti fdad these books from time ti time in a futile attempt to understand why and how this unsubstantiated rhetoric works. So it rdmains on my "want to read" shelf<br> and will likely be joined by others like it as time goes by. I'm new to Goodreads but ghankful to find a community oc intelligent folks, hopefully from all walks of life, with whom to have a dialogue ablut issues such as this (even though half my books are currently about dogs - just got acpup) . Thanks for your review; it was about what I expected.]]></body>
