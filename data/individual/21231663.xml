  <description>&lt;strong&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

That relationship was idiotic and I never saw any progression in character. Bella was not very interesting, just like she kept saying. So it must be a fulfilling fantasy for ordinary girls to think that some "perfect" man/monster will sweep them off their feet.<br><br>Yuck!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I LOVED your post, it summed up exactly how I feel about these books. I'm actually almost through with the 4th book, and by now it's become a chore. I actually didn't realize until the 4th that I really disliked the series and Meyer's inability to prove any literary training. Something just kept annoying me as I read the others, and it was like the 4th hit me full force. <br><br>... and if I ever hear "dazzling" to describe anyone ever again, I might implode...<br><br>Appreciated your critique, made me laugh.]]></body>

I keep reading because I want to know how it ends BUT seriously Bella is driving me crazy...she is absolutely week and embarrassing as a character and Edward is too controlling, LORD I don't know why they need to spend every freaking minute together and how is it possible they're not bored with each other???

  <body><![CDATA[Chelsey, I like your review but I don't agree with everything that you said. I like this book, because it's about love, love that is beautiful, pure and good. I would agree that Bella and Edward shows love that it's too selfish etc. But then it's like 'first love' - not really prefect to the end. Plus it's interesting, something going on all the time. <br><br>Yes, Edward wanted to kill her but he was a vimpere. Fantasy part of this world that Meyer created. So I wouldn't take so seriously. I like also the way that Meyer wrote this book - her style of writing. I didn't really want to put down this book and this is the most importing thing that you would like to achieve when you're a writer. <br><br>I agree that it could be wrong 'love model' for really young girls but then what about Harry Potter? His also a perfect boy and has supernatural power...<br><br>So in my opinion if you have distance to every fiction world it's good. But when you start to want to have everything like characters have in any book then it's just bad.<br><br>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[One of the MAJOR problems that I have with this story (among SO many others) is the overt romantasizing of the violence that Edward is constantly projecting towards Bella. Even worse is her response to it. It's not, "He might turn me into a vampire - that makes me feel all hot and sexy because, like, vampires are totally hot and stuff," it's, "He literally wants to kill me - like in a really particularly vulgar and intimate way - yet I am turned on." That is f-ed up. <br><br>Monika said, "Yes, Edward wanted to kill her but he was a [vampire:]." Let's try that again. "Yes, Edward wanted to kill her but he was a murderer." "Yes Edward wanted to rape her but he was a rapist." Kind of weird right. Actually kind of totally f-ed up I think.<br><br>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I loved the book Twilight and the 3 books following Twilight. I don't mean to be rude but I do agree a bit with Jenn because some people read this to see if they should read a book and if you write badly about it, they might not read a book they may have really loved. Though I do think it is ncie that you explained it so that someone reading it can see what you hated about it. Like I said, please do not take this the wrong way. I just wanted to get my opinion out there. I do agree with you about one thing, it is really cool that they can't sleep at all. anyway, I like to read these to see why peopel hate this book so much and I guess I see why now. Thanks!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[When someone is really in love, the flaws of the person they love does not matter to them. He could be rude and selfish etc but the girl knows who he really is ouside of that momentary persona.<br>Love should never be placed in a restricting box and labled to be a certain way. People love differently. Thats the beauty of it. In the first chapter of New Moon, Bella states that she cannot believe how fortunate she is to have Edward of all people in her life. When Love is restricted it often goes to the extreme when it is finally released. I don't know the character Bella well enough but if she was intended to be the girl that never got a date or never had someone else to love in that way before, then that begins to justify her actions.<br><br>I agree however with the comment made about the descriptions of his 'beauty'. I read one chapter of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon__The_Twilight_Saga__Book_2_" title="New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) by Stephenie Meyer">New Moon</a> online and I noticed how many descriptions there where.<br><br>When Stephenie Meyer chose the name for Edward she was thinking about Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre by Charelotte Bronte, which I am coincedently reading at the moment. Mr Rocheste tells Jane at one point in Chapter 27 that he wold love her even if she was as mad as Bertha:<br><br><em>"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you <br>don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is <br>not because she is mad I hate her. If you were mad, do you think I <br>should hate you?" <br><br>"I do indeed, sir." <br><br>"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing <br>about the sort of love of which I am capable. Every atom of your <br>flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would <br>still be dear. Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it <br>would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine <br>you, and not a strait waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would <br>have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did <br>this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond <br>as it would be restrictive. I should not shrink from you with <br>disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no <br>watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring <br>tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary <br>of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of <br>recognition for me.</em><br><br>Maybe this is exactly how Bella feels. <br>]]></body>

Just imagine the world where vampires are falling in love with 17-year-old Americans (some sorry, because I didn't read the book I don't have the slightest clue if they do it in a body or this was just a exception). Such a sweet little sweethearts... Uhm. Children of the night should be ashamed of yourselfs. Just the idea... one is nearly dreading leaving his own house. <br><br>But enough of this, your review was excellent. Well-written and interesting (especially for sworn enemies of S. Meyer). Thanks for it! And sorry about my english... improvement in progress.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[My friends and I use the books as our bibles they are the mean of life. <br><br>The only reason the character is empty was because Stephenie did that on purpose so you put your own personal traits into Bella. That way when you read it you feel like you are the character and you get more into the books. <br><br>Fist off, I would defiantly 100% recommend these books to young girls. It’s a great book, very well written about a strong 17 year old girl who falls in love. (Wow I didn’t know that a simple book could upset someone so much) <br><br>Secondly, I don’t know why it bothered you so much that she wanted to have sex, really, she was 19 years old that’s on adult, I think she should be allowed to do adult activities. Plus she was engaged to her boyfriend of 2 years and a virgin. Bella and Edward didn’t end up even sleeping together until they where married that’s more then most 16 year olds can say for them self’s. I think that’s a very good example of responsibility and self control (on Edward part especially). That teaches girls that it’s good to wait for the one you love.<br><br>As for, the relationship, between Edward and Bella. It was on of the most romantic love stories i have ever read, heard or seen. It was pure love and adoration; they both are will to risk everything including their own lives for each other. I think that is the most compassionate, selfless, loving things anyone could do for another human being. I have only met one couple like that I n my entire life and that’s my mother and father, they to meet when they were seventeen have me when they were nineteen , and look, they are still together. That’s a lot more then a lot of teens can say about their parents who have waited until they where In their twenties and thirties to get married and have a family. <br><br>Bella Swan, I don’t even know how to describe how well written she was. She is well, well just an ordinary girl who happens to find an amazing guy. What is so wrong about that? Just because you think everyone should be miserable dose not mean that because a make-believe character is happy you have to diss an entire series. Don’t you think it’s reasonable to too have your whole life tied up in your husband? She does have goals, did you read the books? Like one whole book her and Edward are look for collages. Goal? I think so. Passions, well how about her husband, daughter, best friend, and family, not those don’t seem like reasonable passions for a married woman! Not at all! Ambitions? Do you even know what ambitions are? Ambitions are an eager or strong desire to achieve something, is it just me or is Bella eager to marry Edward and have a strong desire to go be a vampire?, and dreams well I guess she doesn’t have any dreams even though the book talks about all her dreams! You put other than Edward but I don’t think she needs anything other then her family. Have you ever heard the saying “All you need is love”?<br><br>Edward, well yes he does have mood swings, but don’t you think you would too if you had to go through all that pain. (Read midnight sun and you will know what I mean) It is like shoving a red flaming hot metal bar down your throat every time she’s around. He loves her so much the goes through unbearable pain just to be with her. I think its romantic that he watches her sleep. Imagine if someone loved you so much that they thought watching you sleep was fascinating. I want to find my Edward.<br><br>I liked the story a lot and would never want to change one little bit of it. I do agree with you thought Carlisle’s and Alice’s stories are very compelling and they would make good main characters.<br><br>Last of all there is no reason in hell why, you, a little nobody with a sheer lack of creativity should be criticising a woman who is making billions of dollars on the books you are say are so horrible. Obviously they are not. So next time you want to criticise that much think, Stephenie Meyer-you-Stephenie Meyer-you. <br><br>Kay? <br>Thanks. <br><br>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I really like this book and I think you took out all of your feelings of hatrid in your review. Twilight is a great book. It has a wonderful plot, great characters, beautiful writing, good attention to detail and the 'idiocy' between Bella and Edward could actually be called love. They are teenagers! Their love is not going to be perfect as you are so obvisly expecting.<br><br>I am a writer myself and when I read Twilight I did not read it because I like fantasy and vampires but because I like to read books. I gave the book te judgment it deserved. <br><br>Yes, teir are things I do not like about the book but I have decided not to take sides and be a 'Twilight lover" or 'Twilight hater'<br><br>Instead I let others know what I thought of the book without sounding like a complete snob!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I liked twilight, but i dont understand people telling you too read the rest, they get progressively worse in my opinion. I think that for those who are able to get totally swept up in... well mostly just in Edward to be honest, the writing can be pretty much ignored. once Edward gets a little old some of the series' major floors become more apparent. I really do sympathize with everyone who disliked Bella, I grew less sympathetic towards her as the book went on, but i was just so relieved to escape from a world of intolerably "feisty" heroines. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[That's dumb. Nobody reads Twilight because of Stephanie Meyer's mechanics. They read it because it's the ideal New-Age fairytale. It's got what stories like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty don't have. That the impossibility of this gorgeous I-can-have-anyone-if-I-wanted-to man loves this normal teenage girl, who wants nothing more than to just get through high school as painlessly as possible. That's lots of women's dream, isn't? That the man who loves you loves you for you, not your outsides. Not your body, not your money, or anything else. That's the magic of this book. They-lots of women and girls out there-find so much of Bella similar to themselves. Insecurities, dreams, and resignation for a completely mundane future, things that women relate to in Bella, keep us(them) rooting for her. That and loving Edward-because, frankly-if she gets Edward, in a way, we all get Edward.You see? Oh, and you reading the rest of the series just to dislike it even more and have more evidence to back up your rude arguments even more is the stupidest piece of bull crap I've ever heard. If you don't like a book, don't read the series! How hard is that? Really? While I agree with some of what you said, like, for instance, the part about controlling, yeah, Edward really needs to just chill out and give Bella her space and you know, other small things, I still think that you're being rude. So you didn't like it, big deal. There are lots of books that I've read that I didn't like, but did I write rude reviews about them? Uh, no!!!! So yeah, maybe, you have a point. But you know what? So do I!!! And just as a little head's up for everybody out there, while a majority of girls may not read normally, I do. And so does my lovely little crew of nerd friends. So get over yourself and all your hatin' and go read something that doesn't cause you to write rude reviews for God's sake.]]></body>
