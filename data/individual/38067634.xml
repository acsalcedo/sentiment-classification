  <description>I wish my thighs were smaller. "If only I could lose ten pounds." A wake-up call for any woman who has engaged in the "if only" wishing game, &lt;em&gt;Locker Room Diaries&lt;/em&gt; uses the unique lens of the locker room to reveal what, exactly, goes into "shaping" not just a woman's body but her body image. The locker room can be a wondrous retreat, a place to toss aside the worries of the day, but it is also where our flaws become most apparent-and where most of us can't help but wonder how we "measure up." Often dressed in no more than a towel, Leslie Goldman spent five years talking with women of all shapes and sizes about their body image, from taut twenty-somethings to heavyset seniors. Why is it, she asks, that almost no one seems satisfied with her physique? From compulsive workouts to daily dates with the scale, from bikini waxes to body fat measurements, American women are swept up in a constant quest for the "perfect" body. Thankfully, more than one woman reveals how she halted her cycle of self-loathing and learned to like her body &lt;em&gt;as is&lt;/em&gt;. Blending expert opinion with wonderfully intimate, often laugh-outloud, confidences, &lt;em&gt;Locker Room Diaries&lt;/em&gt; will inspire anyone who knows the highs of exercise to leave the lows of self-esteem behind-and, most especially, once and for all, to step off that scale!</description>

  <body><![CDATA[AND, many men think their size of that "certain part of the male anatomy" (so cleverly disguised in all those goddamn herbal penis - ahem - "part" enhancement advertisements) is inadequate. Talk about stating the obvious and well known. Don't worry, I will certainly avoid this book. However, you did put it on the "poop" bookshelf. You tricked me, woman! You should re-label it for bad books. Remember, "poop" in my world is a positive, complimentary term! :P]]></body>
