  <description>Mr. Hoppy is in love with Mrs. Silver, but her heart belongs to Alfie, her pet tortoise. Mr. Hoppy is too shy to approach Mrs. Silver, until one day he comes up with a brilliant idea to win her heart. If Mr. Hoppy's plan works, Mrs. Silver will certainly fall in love with him. But it's going to take one hundred and forty tortoises, an ancient spell, and a little bit of magic.</description>

  <body><![CDATA[You lost me at "I watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and loved it". As far as I am concerned being a fan of Dahl and liking those films are mutually exclusive.<br><br>I would be interested though to see what your thoughts on how literature ages, and especially how it relates to children's books. If you argue that no books that carry a message that is not compatible with modern viewpoints on behaviour, gender roles or the emotional link to pets then you are losing a vast swathe of literature, which would be a great shame. <br><br>Esio Trot may be a second rate book by an otherwise great children's author, but I would argue that the themes it explores where valid at the point it was written and it does not deserve the vitriol you have thrown at it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Patrick, much as I love Kvothe and company, I cannot feel but that you are missing the point of Dahl.<br><br>Dahl is dark, even at his lightest. This is a light story, but as you can expect in any of his works there is a twisted element to the story. However consider that in the end, no animals are hurt, a little girl gets a pet, and the couple are happy ever after. That's not bad by Dahl standards.<br><br>Sure there is a 'trick' which is the core of the courtship, but really they would hardly have been happy together if that was all there was to the relationship. Really it's an over complex means by which our 'protagonist' can express his feelings to the object of his love. That she isn't the brightest bulb in the box is just a character trait. It's not like Dahl was shy of writing strong female characters.<br><br>Further Dahl is being somewhat of a realist. Many relationships in the real world are built on even worses bases than this. You are someone who I would expect to appreciate not feeding sweetness and roses tales to kids.<br><br>So sure you might prefer a different story, but then that would be your story, not Dahl's. <br><br>Your opinion if of course your own, and no one can expect you to like that which you do not. However I think your critique is simply missing the point of Dahl in general: the world is weird, a bit dark, but despite all of that, and the weirdness of people, you can find happiness.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I have to say, I'd never read this book despite growing up with the "BFG" myself and loving it very much. I'm now rather relieved that I never read it. I'm not comfortable with what's being presented as acceptable in the story and I wouldn't want my kids exposed to it. I'm glad you found a way to change things around and give Oot a better story even if he did know it wasn't the original. One day, he'll read it himself and know you gave him a story that was better than the original and be grateful to have a dad that cared enough about him to make something like that up on the fly.<br><br>Also, I'm glad I'm not the only one that didn't love "James and the Giant Peach."]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This coming from the author of "The Adventures of the Princess and Mr. Whiffle." Roald Dahl stories always have darker subtext and twists. I get that your son is very young and that your version teaches a much more simplistic and palatable moral, but your critique is toward young adult books. Terrible stories and terrible morals abound in fiction and reality; yet all can be tools to learn.]]></body>

I suspect my mother may have edited this from the collection now, totally going to ask her. Knowing her she probably just didn't like the pet being discarded and knew I'd cry over it for months.<br>I used to cry over the trix commercials because no one would give the rabbit any trix. *sigh*]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[If you read other Dahl stories (and his Revolting Rhymes) you will see that he is deliberately subverting the idea of childhood innocence, and appealing to the devilment in children. It is entirely tongue in cheek. If the child is old enough to read it themselves, then they know this; if not then the parent does and uses their tone of voice to portray it. Children's literature has come a long way since the days of monotonous moralistic and instrumental works like Little Women (and your version above).<br><br>I am a great fan of your work (and usually your blogs) but if I'm honest I think your version is tedious and insipid. As a parent you have to think about your child and obviously their age needs to be accounted, I don't know how old your child is but I will continue (like tens of millions of others) to read Dahl to my kids, and not the drivel you came up with.<br><br>If you don't want your child hearing it, then don't tell it. Your aggressive rant is completely inconsistent with the context, and aside from the swearing you sound like(ironically) a ranting child.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree that Esio Triot is not Dahl's best work, and I do like your version better. However, if you've only ever read one other Dahl book, you're missing out.<br><br>He has written some wonderful, empowering, exhilarating fiction for kids. I hope you'll try Matilda, or Fantastic Mr. Fox, or especially Danny the Champion of the World.<br><br>I also hope you don't keep Oot and Cutie from reading any of his other books, based on your experience with this one.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Woah! As someone who also grew up reading the BFG (along with my 4 siblings) I can't believe this is now what's flowing from this author's pen. I would never read that to a child - I think what you did was great, but it's really absurd that it had to be done at all. Who "green lights" a book like that???]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Have you read The Boxcar Children? Or Nancy Drew, or the Hardy Boys? The Boxcar Children has some pretty obvious gender roles, but that was due to when it was written I think. Has some wonderfully strong child characters, and a lesson that just because someone might seem scary at first doesn't mean that they aren't nice. Canary Red is a fabulous book about a girl who's mother is dead and her father gets out of prison and has custody. Only he went in when she was a baby and they don't know one another. And yes, it's YA. Another book that teaches tolerence and understanding.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[This makes me think about that article where Michelle Nijhuis talks about gender-swapping the main characters of books she reads to her kids, most notably making Bilbo a girl in The Hobbit. Thought it was a fascinating kind of reversal, and intriguing food for thought. :)]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[What a wonderful story you created out of an unpleasant beginning! I second the comments here when people urge you to put your version of the story in writing -- for Oot if not for the rest of the world. I never read much Dahl growing up - I was more of a Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, Grimm's Fairy Tales (the original versions) and Shel Silverstein person growing up. Thus, those are the authors I read to my son as a child.]]></body>
