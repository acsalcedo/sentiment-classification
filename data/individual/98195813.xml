  <description>The extraordinary story of a man's quest for truth. It will change the way you think and feel about your life. "The cycle you're working on is a cycle called 'yourself.'"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The study of the art of motorcycle maintainence is really a study of the art of rationality itself. Working on a motorcycle, working well, caring, is to become part of a process, to achieve an inner peace of mind. The motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon." -- Robert M. Pirsig&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Profoundly important... full of insights into our most perplexing contemporary dilemmas... It is intellectual entertainment of the highest order." -- "The New York Times"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It lodges in the mind as few recent novels have... The book is inspired, original... As the mountains gentle toward the sea--with father and child locked in a ghostly grip--the narrative tact, the perfect economy of effect defy criticism... The analogies with "Moby Dick" are patent. Robert Pirsig invites the prodigious comparison... What more can one say?" -- "The New Yorker"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's a miracle.. sparkles like an electric dream. Freshness, originality... that seduces you into loving motorcycles, as tender in their pistons as the petals in the Buddah's dawn lotus." -- "The Village Voice"</description>

      <![CDATA[I hated this book. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated it. I'm sad no stars is not actually a rating. This is my least favorite book ever. And I've done a lot of reading. <br /><br />The problem is that it is written by some guy who apparently thinks he is God's gift to philosophy. And if you don't agree with...]]>

  <body><![CDATA[Don't you think he distances himself from... himself? (with Phaedrus) He acknowledges the ideas are "insane" and frequently said "if I were him - I would've stopped here"? So in the end in lots of it he isn't saying "it's right because I said so" it's more "it's insane and here's a lesser everyday use for some of his insane ideas"?]]></body>
